            [On the distinction between <i>essence</i> and <i>existence</i>]
			<blockquote>
                <p>If one considers an article of manufacture as, for example, a book or a paper-knife&mdash;one sees that it has been made by an artisan who had a conception of it; and he has paid attention, equally, to the conception of a paper-knife and to the pre-existent technique of production which is a part of that conception and is, at bottom, a formula. Thus the paper-knife is at the same time an article producible in a certain manner and one which, on the other hand, serves a definite purpose, for one cannot suppose that a man would produce a paper-knife without knowing what it was for. Let us say, then, of the paper-knife that its essence&mdash;that is to say the sum of the formulae and the qualities which made its production and its definition possible&mdash; precedes its existence.</p>
				<p>. . .</p>
				<p>There is at least one being whose existence comes before its essence, a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it. That being is man or, as Heidegger has it, the human reality. What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world&mdash;and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. ... Man simply is. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he wills, and as he conceives himself after already existing&mdash;as he wills to be after tha leap toward existence. Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism.</p>

            <blockquote>
                The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophise, on the contrary, we find ... that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things with an unfamiliar aspect.

            <blockquote>
                Many if not most philosophers have regarded the actual as banal, and concepts as much more interesting&mdash;they have seen our individual perceptions and experiences as trivial, concepts somehow &lsquo;higher&rsquo;&mdash;and have therefore tried to deepen our understanding of the world by examining concepts. In doing this they are like a man who empties a box so as to be able to look inside and see what is in it.

            <blockquote>
                It has always seemed to me that in practice most people professionally concerned with philosophy grossly exagerrate the importance of arguments. ... It <i>cannot</i> be the case that what is most important about what a philopsopher has to convey to us is introduced by his arguments, unless his problems are primarily technical ones of logic: it must lie already in the insights, judgements, perceptions, points of view, choices, formulations and so on that stock his premises. True, it is only by means of argument that he can lay before us the full implications of what he is saying&mdash;and for that matter it is probably only by such chains of reasoning that he can expect to work them out even for himself&mdash;so in practice it is usually only by argument that he can get fully to understand his own position, and get us fully to understand it too, and can hope to persuade us of its cogency. But these, and only these, are the chief functions of argument. ... Argument is the great vehicle of insight and as such is to be prized above rubies; but to be prized more highly still is the insight of which it is the vehicle, and this is not itself an argument, nor could it have been arrived at by argument, and nor of course does it need to be conveyed by argument. It is this insight, not the arguments that usually convey it, that philosophy is ultimately for, or about. But this, I fear, has been lost sight of by many, if not most, professional philosophers.

                I am awed and discomforted by what technology like AI might accomplish and signify. But I am also deeply uncertain. From day to day, I shift between elation and fear, hope and cynicism. And the thing that worries me most of all is the flipside of our appetite for novelty: how soon the shock of the new subsides into normality; how easily we confuse whatever order we're born into with the underlying nature of things. In this sense, the great purpose (if not the tools) of philosophy remains one Socrates set 2,500 years ago: to banish complacency; to insist on wondering at the strangeness of our self-invention.

                <p>It behooves us to say, before all, that philosophy lies closer to poetry than to science. . . .</p>
				<p>And, though they concern us so greatly, and are, indeed, indispensable for our life and thought, the sciences are in a certain sense more foreign to us than philosophy. They fulfill a more objective end&mdash;that is to say, an end more external to ourselves. They are fundamentally a matter of economics. A new scientific discovery, of the kind called theoretical, is, like a mechanical discovery&mdash;that of the steam-engine, the telephone, the phonograph, or the aeroplane—a thing which is useful for something else. Thus the telephone may be useful to us in enabling us to communicate at a distance with the woman we love. But she, wherefore is she useful to us? A man takes an electric tram to go to hear the opera, and asks himself, Which, in this case, is the more useful, the tram or the opera?</p>

                Philosophy, if it cannot <i>answer</i> so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of <i>asking</i> questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.

                <p>All knowledge, we find, must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing is left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than others, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with other beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part of what is believed instinctively.</p>
				<p>Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs, beginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. It should take care to show that, in the form in which they are finally set forth, our instinctive beliefs do not clash, but form a harmonious system. There can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief except that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to harmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.</p>
				<p>. . . . Hence, by organizing our instinctive beliefs and their consequences, by considering which among them is most possible, if necessary, to modify or abandon, we can arrive, on the basis of accepting as our sole data what we instinctively believe, at an orderly systematic organization of our knowledge, in which, though the possibility of error remains, its likelihood is diminished by the interrelation of the parts and by the critical scrutiny which has preceded acquiescence.</p>
				<p>This function, at least, philosophy can perform.</p>

                I find philosophy&mdash;philosophy in the largest sense&mdash;a profoundly concrete, sensual activity. I know others who feel the same. The world of ideas seems as solid as the world of seas and mountains&mdash;or more so. One can no more change its topography than one can move Samarqand closer to Bukhara, although one can discover new views or discover that one has gotten the topography wrong, or that many people have for many years. Ideas seem as embodied, in the world of ideas, with its views and obstructions and vastness, as we do in our material world. They seem tangible, with specific savors, aesthetic properties, emotional tones, curves, surfaces, insides, hidden places, structure, geometry, dark passages, shining corners, auras, force fields, and combinatorial chemistry. This is one great reason why &ldquo;traveling, whether in the mental or the physical world, is a joy,&rdquo; as Bertrand Russell said, and why &ldquo;it is good to know that, in the mental world at least, there are vast countries still very imperfectly explored.&rdquo;

                <p>The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechamism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; reproduced and combined.</p>
				<p>There is, of course, a certain connection between those elements and relevant logical concepts. It is also clear that the desire to arrive finally at logically connected concepts is the emotional basis of this rather vague play with the above mentioned elements. But taken from a psychological viewpoint, this combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought&mdash;before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others.</p>
				. . . Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will.
