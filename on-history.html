			[Social] researchers do not &ldquo;see&rdquo; or &ldquo;discover&rdquo; the one, reified truth of a culture; they construct a truth through the process of collecting, studying, and analyzing. What researchers construct is always, in part, a product of their cultural frame of reference, and therefore the moral and political agenda they are trying to prove or justify. Since prejudices are unavoidable, and in fact, indispensable to our ability to &ldquo;see&rdquo; and analyze <i>anything</i>, we have to become comfortable with a central paradox of the constructionist, interpretive enterprise: we should not impose the notions or prejudices of our cultural clearing, and yet we cannot help but do so. The trick, I suppose, is to be <i>aware</i> of what we are doing. ... Somehow if we are going to be curious and inquisitive in the world, we will have to learn how to tolerate the paradoxes inherent in being culturally and historically embedded beings. We will have to learn how to develop a sense of humor about the impossible position of being human, about being apart from and a part of, uninitiated and knower, stranger and landsman.

			<blockquote>
			As regards human intelligence, it has not been sufficiently noted that mechanical invention has been from the first its essential feature, that even to-day our social life gravitates around the manufacture and use of artificial instruments, that the inventions which strew the road of progress have also traced its direction. This we hardly realise, because it takes us longer to change ourselves than to change our tools. Our individual and even social habits survive a good while the circumstances for which they were made, so that the ultimate effects of an invention are not observed until its novelty is already out of sight. ... In thousands of years, when, seen from the distance, only the broad lines of the present age will still be visible, our wars and our revolutions will count for little, even supposing they are remembered at all; but the steam-engine, and the procession of invention of every kind that accompanied it, will perhaps be spoken of as we speak of the bronze or of the chipped stone of prehistoric times: it will serve to define an age. If we could rid ourselves of all pride, if, to define our species, we kept strictly to what the historic and the prehistoric periods show us to be the constant characteristic of man and of intelligence, we should say not Homo sapiens, but Homo faber. In short, intelligence, considered in what seems to be its original feature, is the faculty of manufacturing artificial objects, especially tools to make tools, and of indefinitely varying the manufacture.
