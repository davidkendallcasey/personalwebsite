            <blockquote>
                ​Ivan Ivanich came out of the cabin, plunged into the water with a splash and swam in the rain, thrusting his arms out wide; he raised waves on which white lilies swayed. He swam out to the middle of the river and dived and a minute later came up in another spot and swam on and kept diving, trying to touch bottom. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he kept repeating delightedly, &ldquo;by God!&rdquo; He swam to the mill, spoke to the peasants there, and turned back and in the middle of the river lay floating, exposing his face to the rain. Buskin and Alyohin were already dressed and ready to leave, but he kept on swimming and diving. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he kept exclaiming. &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me.&rdquo;
