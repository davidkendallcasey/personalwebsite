                Art is not difficult because it wishes to be difficult, but because it wishes to be art. However much the writer might long to be, in his work, simple, honest, and straightforward, these virtues are no longer available to him. He discovers that in being simple, honest, and straightforward, nothing much happens: he speaks the speakable, whereas what we are looking for is the as-yet unspeakable, the as-yet unspoken.

                <p>Let us suppose that I am the toughest banjulele player in town and I have been contracted to play &ldquo;Melancholy Baby&rdquo; for six hours before an audience that will include the four next-toughest banjulele players in town. We imagine the smoky basement club, the hustling waiters (themselves students of the jazz banjulele) . . . forming a congenial group at the bar. There is one thing of which you may be sure: I am not going to play &ldquo;Melancholy Baby&rdquo; as written. Rather I will play something that is parallel, in some sense, to &ldquo;Melancholy Baby,&rdquo; having to do with &ldquo;Melancholy Baby,&rdquo; made out of &ldquo;Melancholy Baby&rdquo;&mdash;commentary, exegesis, elaboration, contradiction. The interest of my construction, if any, is located in the space between the new entity I have constructed and the &ldquo;real&rdquo; &ldquo;Melancholy Baby,&rdquo; which remains in the mind as the horizon which bounds my efforts.</p>
                <p>This is, I think, the relation of art to the world. I suggest that art is always a meditation upon external reality rather than a representation of external reality or a jackleg attempt to &ldquo;be&rdquo; external reality.</p>
                <p>...</p>
				<p>Style enables us to speak, to imagine again. Beckett speaks of &ldquo;the long sonata of the dead&rdquo;&mdash;where on earth did the word sonata come from, imposing as it does an orderly, even exalted design upon the most disorderly, distressing phenomenon known to us? The fact is not challenged, but understood, momentarily, in a new way. It's our good fortune to be able to imagine alternative realities, other possibilities. We can quarrel with the world, constructively...</p>

​				<p>They take them out in the morning<br>

				and put them against the wall</p>

				<p>five men<br>
				two of them very young<br>

				in the garish light<br>
				of obviousness<br></p>
				<p>the yellow wall<br>
				the cold blue<br>
				the black wire on the wall<br>
				instead of a horizon</p>

				<p>that is the moment<br>
				when the five senses rebel<br>
				they would gladly escape<br>
				like rats from a sinking ship</p>

				<p>before the bullet reaches its destination<br>
				the eye will perceive the flight of the projectile<br>
				the ear record the steely rustle<br>
				the nostrils will be filled with biting smoke<br>
				a petal of blood will brush the palate<br>
				the touch will shrink and then slacken</p>

				<p>now they lie on the ground<br>
				covered up to their eyes with shadow<br>
				the platoon walks away<br>
				their button strap<br>
				and steel helmets<br>
				are more alive<br>
				than those lying beside the wall</p>
				
				<p>3</p>
				
				<p>I did not learn this today<br>
				I knew this before yesterday</p>

				<p>so why have I been writing<br>
				unimportant poems on flowers</p>

				<p>what did the five talk of<br>
				the night before the execution</p>

				<p>of prophetic dreams<br>
				of an escapade in a brothel<br>
				of automobile parts<br>
				of a sea voyage<br>
				of how when he had spades<br>
				he ought to have opened<br>
				of how vodka is best<br>
				after wine you get a headache<br>
				of girls<br>
				of fruit<br>
				of life</p>

				<p>thus one can use in poetry<br>
				names of Greek shepherds<br>
				one can attempt to catch the color of morning sky<br>
				write of love<br>
				and also<br>
				once again<br>
				in dead earnest<br>
				offer to the betrayed world<br>
				a rose</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The grotesque is a structure. Its nature could be summed up in a phrase ... : <em>the grotesque is the estranged world</em>. But some additional explanation is required. For viewed from the outside, the world of the fairy tale could also be regarded as strange and alien. Yet its world is not estranged, that is to say, the elements in it which are familiar and natural to us do not suddenly turn out to be strange and ominous. It is our world which has to be transformed. Suddenness and surprise are essential elements of the grotesque. In literature the grotesque appears in a scene or an animated tableau. Its representations in the plastic arts, too, do not refer to a state of repose but to an action, a &ldquo;pregnant moment,&rdquo; or at least&mdash;in the case of Kafka&mdash;a situation that is filled with ominous tension. . . . We are so strongly affected and terrified because it is our world which ceases to be reliable, and we feel that we would be unable to live in this changed world. The grotesque instills fear of life rather than fear of death. Structurally, it presupposes that the categories which apply to our world view become inapplicable. . . . [It is] the fusion of realms which we know to be separated, the abolition of the law of statics, the loss of identity, the distortion of &ldquo;natural&rdquo; size and shape, the suspension of the category of objects, the destruction of personality, and the fragmentation of the historical order.</p>
				<p>But who effects the estrangement of the world, who announces his presence in this overwhelming ominousness? Only now do we plumb the final depth of the horror that is inspired by the transformed world. These questions remain unanswered. Apocalyptic beasts emerge from the abyss; demons intrude upon us. If we were able to name those powers and relate them to the cosmic order, the grotesque would lose its essential quality. . . . One could use another descriptive phrase and characterize the grotesque as the objectification of the &ldquo;It,&rdquo; the ghostly &ldquo;It&rdquo;&mdash;in contrast to the psychological &ldquo;It&rdquo; (it pleases me = I am glad) and the cosmic &ldquo;It&rdquo; (it rains)&mdash;the &ldquo;It&rdquo; which Ammann defined as the third meaning of the impersonal pronoun.</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<p><em>The grotesque is a play with the absurd.</em> It may begin in a gay and carefree manner. ... But it may also carry the player away, deprive him of his freedom, and make him afraid of the ghosts which he so frivolously invoked. And now no helper comes to his rescue. The creators of grotesques have no advice that they can follow. ...</p>
				<p>In many grotesques, little is to be felt of ... freedom and gaiety. But where the artistic creation has succeeded, a faint smile seems to pass rapidly across the scene or picture, and slight traces of the playful frivolity of the capriccio appear to be present. And there, but only there, another kind of feeling arises within us. In spite of all the helplessness and horror inspired by the dark forces which lurk in and behind our world and have power to estrange it, the truly artistic portrayal effects a secret liberation. The darkness has been sighted, the ominous places discovered, the incomprehensible forces challenged. And thus we arrive at a final interpretation of the grotesque: <em>an attempt to invoke and subdue the demonic aspects of the world</em>.</p>

			[Watching the movie Blue Velvet by David Lynch] was my first hint that being a surrealist, or being a &ldquo;weird&rdquo; writer, didn't exempt you from certain responsibilities, but in fact it obligated and upped them&mdash;that whatever the project of surrealism is works way better if 99.9 percent of it is absolutely real. I mean, most of the word &ldquo;surrealism&rdquo; is &ldquo;realism&rdquo;; it's extra-realism, something on top of realism. It's that one thing in a Lynch frame that's off&mdash;that if everything else weren't picture perfect and totally structured, wouldn't hit.

            <blockquote>
			It is the subject of <em>willing</em>, that is to say, his own will, which fills the consciousness of the lyrical author, often as a free and satisfied willing (joy), but much more often as a frustrated willing (sadness), and always as an emotion, a passion, a state of mind. Yet, alongside and at the same time as this state, the glances that the poet casts on the nature all around him make him aware of himself as a pure subject of knowledge, independent of willing, whose imperturbable spiritual peace contrasts with the desires of the ever-pressured, ever-greedy will: the feeling of this contrast, of this alternation, is expressed in the genre of lyric poems, and constitutes in short the lyrical state of mind. In this state, <em>pure knowledge</em> comes to us to deliver us from willing and its torments: we surrender ourselves to it, but only for a moment; ever and again the will, and the memory of our personal goals, comes to tear us away from peaceful contemplation; but again and again the beauty of our surroundings, through which a knowledge liberated from willing is offered to us, comes to seduce us. That is why, in song and lyrical inspiration, the will (self-interested and personal views) and the pure intuition of our surroundings are admirably mixed: reconciliations between the two are sought out and imagined; the subjective disposition of mind, the affection of willing, plays a part in the intuition of the surrounding world, and reciprocally lends its colours to it: the true lyric poem is the imprint of these mixed and shared states of mind.

			<blockquote>
			It is one of our problems that as we become crowded together, the sounds we make to each other, in our increasingly complex communication systems, become more random-sounding, accidental or incidental, and we have trouble selecting meaningful signals out of the noise. One reason is, of course, that we do not seem able to restrict our communication to information-bearing, relevant signals. Given any new technology for transmitting information, we seem bound to use it for great quantities of small talk. We are only saved by music from being overwhelmed by nonsense.

			It is sometimes remarked, not by enemies of fiction but by people who love it, that whereas scientists and politicians work for progress, the writer of fiction restates what has always been known, finding new expressions for familiar truths, adapting to the age truths that may seem outmoded. ... But the fact remains that art produces the most important progress civilization knows. Restating old truths and adapting them to the age, applying them in ways they were never before applied, stirring up emotion by the inherent power of narrative, visual image, or music, artists crack the door to the morally necessary future.

			<p>[I]t is evident that a painted image—intangible by its very nature—hides nothing, while the tangibly visible object hides another visible thing—if we trust our experience.</p>
			<p>For a time a curious priority has been accorded “the invisible,” owing to a confused literature, whose interest vanishes if we remember that the visible can be hidden, but the invisible hides nothing; it can be known or not known, no more. There is no reason to accord more importance to the invisible than to the visible, nor vice versa.</p>

			We’re always rationally explaining and articulating things, but we’re at our most intelligent in the moment just before we start to explain or articulate. Great art occurs, or doesn’t, in that instant. What we turn to art for is precisely this moment when we know something, we feel it, but can’t articulate it because it’s too complex and multiple. But the knowing, in such moments, though happening without language, is real. I’d say this is what art is for. To remind us that this other sort of knowing is not only real, it’s superior to our usual, conceptual, reductive way.

			​Cicero says, &ldquo;It is certain that truth (by which he means nature) in everything, excels imitation; but if that were sufficient of itself in action, we should have no occasion for art.&rdquo;
			<p>In his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better judge?) art, in this case, as well as in many others, if well managed, will assist and improve nature. But this is not all; for sometimes we find the force of it so great and powerful, that, where it is wholly counterfeit, it will for the time work the same effect as if it were founded in truth. This is well known to those who have been conversant with the representations of the theatre. In tragedies, though we are sensible that everything we see and hear is counterfeit; yet such is the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by it in the same manner as if it were all reality.</p>
			<p>Anger and resentment, at the appearance of cruelty, concern and solicitude for distressed virtue, rise in our breasts; and tears are extorted from us for oppressed innocence: though at the same time, perhaps, we are ready to laugh at ourselves for being thus decoyed.</p>
