            <blockquote>
                To perceive, to allow the things themselves to speak to us, to apprehend and grasp new relations between them, and then to precipitate and deposit all this into new concepts, in order to possess it with certainty; this is what gives us new knowledge. ... The innermost kernel of every genuine and actual piece of knowledge is a perception; every new truth is also the fruit of such a perception. ... If we go to the bottom of the matter, all truth and wisdom, in fact the ultimate secret of things, is contained in everything actual, yet certainly only <i>in concreto</i> and like gold hidden in the ore. The question is how to extract it.

Pluto resented this, and Jupiter, at his request, struck the bold physician with lightning, and killed him, but after his death received him into the number of the gods.

            The <i>Semmelweis Reflex</i> describes the phenomenon by which physicians and other medical scientists and practioners ignore or expressly criticize any new theory that goes against the status quo, even despite strong evidence in its favor.
			<p>It is named for Ignaz Semmelweis, the 19th-century Hungarian physician who first theorized that maternal death could be wrought by obstetric physicians not washing their hands after performing autopsies, and for this was criticized and ridiculed until his death in an insane asylum&mdash;this despite that every hospital where he worked saw maternal death rates drop dramatically, only to see them rise when he departed.</p>

                It’s been my experience that patients are interested in the diagnostic process. You are thinking and talking about them, after all. A genuine interest in their problem is one of the key steps to establishing bandwidth and a relationship with the patient. I tell them what diseases I considered as well as which I discounted as less likely.
				<p>History taking is a dynamic process and not an interrogation. When given more information or simply more time, the patient’s answer can change. As a result, the physician’s explanation phase sometimes elicits further details from the patient that they now recall. Patients should feel comfortable elaborating or changing their answers. You can facilitate this process by repeating questions; &ldquo;I know you’ve already answered this, but could you clarify again when you first vomited?&rdquo; Patients are cued that this piece of information is important to your analysis and they will give it further thought.</p>
				<p>Your job is not only to listen and incorporate the information provided, but also to mirror to the patient that you’ve heard them. When I share &ldquo;I don’t have an answer today, but I’ll be smarter next week when you return,&rdquo; the patient understands the process. You are becoming a team.</p>

            <blockquote>
                The modern emphasis of &ldquo;psychosomatic medicine&rdquo; is encouraging in intent. But so far as it denotes something new and apart from medicine, it is a retrogressive concept, for all medicine is psychosomatic. Just as there can be no disease without a patient, there can be no organic disease without emotional reverberations. Nor can there be emotional upheavals without bodily representation. Knowledge of the extent to which each of these two factors is operative and an estimate of their relative importance in each patient are essential to accurate and successful therapy. . . .
				<p>Every physician has encountered patients who have continuing multiple subjective complaints as a necessary ingredient of their lives. They require lifelong repeated reassurance. . . . It is essential that the physician recognize that the production of symptoms is part of the sustenance of life for such patients and that the continued production of symptoms is not a reflection of his incompetence or inadequacy. Recognizing this, a physician can often be the support that enables such a patient to walk successfully through life. The patient is released from some of his anxiety, feels secure despite his continued inner turbulence, and is confident that any organic disturbance requiring specific treatment will be identified. . . .</p>
				<p>It is sometimes said that people come into the world alone and that they die alone. Surely, no greater solace can be afforded to some patients than to stand vigil with them as they pass into eternity.</p>

            <blockquote>
                Even now, despite our standardized profession, each doctor expresses his own individuality, the product of his own efforts in the assiduous application of what little brains the fates give him. The doctor that faces the patient is the product of his own individuality which expresses itself in human understanding, in scientific knowledge, and the art of its application. To socialize medicine is to remove the human touch, to suppress this individualizing of the doctor, it makes of the patient just a case, just as a sick horse is not a patient but a case.
				<p>. . .</p>
				<p>But there is a more intimate reason why we try to advance medical knowledge. Perhaps I am revealing a professional secret when I admit that doctors sometimes make mistakes. Even though we bury them, as we are facetiously accused of doing, that does not blot them from memory. A catastrophe, whether preventable or not, sticks in the unfortunate Aesculapian's memory, or wherever it is such things stick. They hurt and hurt terribly, and we really want to avoid a repetition. Sometimes I think that whoever it was that calculated three score and ten was about all anyone could endure of this life must have had doctors in mind. For by the time a doctor reaches that age his mind is so full of tragic memories that the limit of endurance is just about reached. He forgets his successes, as things normally expected of him; but the tragedies, like Banquo's ghost, will not down. . . . And what is more disturbing still, they also lurk just around the corner as imminent possibilities. Such things are a constant incentive to higher education, and spur on the hunt for new facts which will protect us from past errors. We doctors wear poker faces, or at least are accused of doing so, while dispensing our opinion, in which we do not differ from lawyers and preachers. We do so because we so often have our errors thrust upon us. The patient has the last guess; if he dies he is dead. . . . When a doctor says nothing it is a cause for thanksgiving. When we assume a jocular vein it may not be very deep. My father once said that we are given a sense of humor that we may cloak our grief.</p>

                ​I do not know a better training for a writer than to spend some years in the medical profession. I suppose that you can learn a good deal about human nature in a solicitor’s office; but there on the whole you have to deal with men in full control of themselves. They lie perhaps as much as they lie to the doctor, but they lie more consistently, and it may be that for the solicitor it is not so necessary to know the truth. The interests he deal with, besides, are usually material. He sees human nature from a specialized standpoint. But the doctor, especially the hospital doctor, sees it bare. Reticences can generally be undermined; very often there are none. Fear for the most part will shatter every defence; even vanity is unnerved by it. . . . The doctor is discreet. It is his business to listen and no details are too intimate for his ears.

                Conspiracies of silence are not in and of themselves evil things. They are, however, harmful when they allow a group to practice without any incentives to curb their excesses. A problem exists for the profession of medicine when the lessons of silence are learned without the concomitant lesson that the professional himself has the responsibility to correct his errors. Professional responsibility is itself thought of as individual and not corporate responsibility.

                [A]s a social phenomenon, an epidemic has a dramaturgic form. Epidemics start at a moment in time, proceed on a stage limited in space and duration, follow a plot line of increasing and revelatory tension, move to a crisis of individual and collective character, then drift toward closure. In another of its dramaturgic aspects, an epidemic takes on the quality of pageant—mobilizing communities to act out proprietory rituals that incorporate and reaffirm fundamental social values and modes of understanding. It is their public character and dramatic intensity—along with unity of place and time—that makes epidemics as well suited to the concerns of moralists as to the research of scholars seeking an understanding of the relationship among ideology, social structure, and the construction of particular selves. . . . Just as a playwright chooses a theme and manages plot development, so a particular society constructs its characteristic response to an epidemic.

		[King &AElig;acus of &AElig;gina, on a plague sent to the island by the goddess Juno; a depiction of plague whose motifs permeate modern such depictions to this day]
            <blockquote>
                &ldquo;While the disease appeared to spring from natural causes we resisted it, as we best might, by natural remedies; but it soon appeared that the pestilence was too powerful for our efforts, and we yielded. At the beginning the sky seemed to settle down upon the earth, and thick clouds shut in the heated air. For four months together a deadly south wind prevailed. The disorder affected the wells and springs; thousands of snakes crept over the land and shed their poison in the fountains. The force of the disease was first spent on the lower animals&mdash;dogs, cattle, sheep, and birds. The luckless plowman wondered to see his oxen fall in the midst of their work, and lie helpless in the unfinished furrow. The wool fell from the bleating sheep, and their bodies pined away. The horse, once foremost in the race, contested the palm no more, but groaned at his stall and died an inglorious death. The wild boar forgot his rage, the stag his swiftness, the bears no longer attacked the herds. Everything languished; dead bodies lay in the roads, the fields, and the woods; the air was poisoned by them, I tell you what is hardly credible, but neither dogs nor birds would touch them, nor starving wolves. Their decay spread the infection. Next the disease attacked the country people, and then the dwellers in the city. At first the cheek was flushed, and the breath drawn with difficulty. The tongue grew rough and swelled, and the dry mouth stood open with its veins enlarged and gasped for the air. Men could not bear the heat of their clothes or their beds, but preferred to lie on the bare ground; and the ground did not cool them, but, on the contrary, they heated the spot where they lay. Nor could the physicians help, for the disease attacked them also, and the contact of the sick gave them infection, so that the most faithful were the first victims. At last all hope of relief vanished, and men learned to look upon death as the only deliverer from disease. Then they gave way to every inclination, and cared not to ask what was expedient, for nothing was expedient. All restraint laid aside, they crowded around the wells and fountains and drank till they died, without quenching thirst. Many had not strength to get away from the water, but died in the midst of the stream, and others would drink of it notwithstanding. Such was their weariness of their sick beds that some would creep forth, and if not strong enough to stand, would die on the ground. They seemed to hate their friends, and got away from their homes, as if, not knowing the cause of their sickness, they charged it on the place of their abode. Some were seen tottering along the road, as long as they could stand, while others sank on the earth, and turned their dying eyes around to take a last look, then closed them in death.&rdquo;

                Callisto was [a] maiden who excited the jealousy of Juno, and the goddess changed her into a bear. &ldquo;I will take away,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that beauty with which you have captivated my husband.&rdquo; Down fell Callisto on her hands and knees; she tried to stretch out her arms in supplication—they were already beginning to be covered with black hair. Her hands grew rounded, became armed with crooked claws, and served for feet; her mouth, which Jove used to praise for its beauty, became a horrid pair of jaws; her voice, which if unchanged would have moved the heart to pity, became a growl, more fit to inspire terror. Yet her former disposition remained. . . . Ah, how often, afraid to stay in the woods all night alone, she wandered about the neighborhood of her former haunts; how often, frightened by the dogs, did she, so lately a huntress, fly in terror from the hunters! Often she fled from the wild beasts, forgetting that she was now a wild beast herself; and, bear as she was, was afraid of the bears.

                In a novel by Joy Williams called <i>State of Grace</i>, a character says, &ldquo;There must be something beyond love.

				<p>I see no reason or need for my doctor to love me&mdash;nor would I expect him to suffer with me.
