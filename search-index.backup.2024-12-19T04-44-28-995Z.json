In old age, they almost all inevitable decline; for it is then that we are abandoned by love, banter, the pleasures of travelling and horse riding, as well as the aptitude to play a part in the world, and even by our friends and relatives who are taken from us by death. It is then, more than ever, that there returns the question of knowing what every man has for himself, because that is what will last the longest.\n            \n            Arthur Schopenhauer\n        \n\n        \n            \n                A man very often goes on living after he has completely lost the capacity of taking from life that wherein we are wont to see its essence and meaning. More striking still, a broken man is generally deprived of everything except the ability to acknowledge and feel his position. Nay, for the most part in such cases the intellectual abilities are refined and sharpened and increased to colossal proportions. It frequently happens that an average man, banal and mediocre, is changed beyond all recognition when he falls into the exceptional situation of [being close to death]. In him appear signs of a gift, a talent, even of genius. Nietzsche once asked: 'Can an ass be tragical?' He left his question unanswered, but Tolstoi answered for him in The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Ivan Ilyich . . . is a mediocre, average character, one of those men who pass through life avoiding anything that is difficult or problematical, caring exclusively for the calm and pleasantness of earthly existence. Hardly had the cold wind of tragedy blown upon him, than he was utterly transformed. The story of Ivan Ilyich in his last days is as deeply interesting as the life-story of Socrates or Pascal.\n            \n            Lev Shestov, Anton Tchekhov, and Other Essays\n        \n\n        \n            \n                While extreme stress can quickly kill a plant, small amounts of stress can trigger survival responses as the plant adapts to its environment. For example, outdoor plants that are exposed to lower water conditions can become hardier in the long run. In other words, the stress triggers the plant's survival instinct. For a rootbound plant, the response is a little different, though the motivation is the same. As the roots become more tightly contained within the planter, the Bird of Paradise will believe that it has reached the end of its growth potential and will respond accordingly. Why does that lead to flowering? Because, while we enjoy flowers for their beauty, blooms are actually how a plant propagates its species. Plants don't produce flowers under every kind of stress, in part because some forms of stress would make it difficult to produce blooms—such as dehydration or lack of light. But since an otherwise healthy Bird of Paradise doesn't know if it will survive the threat of crowding its roots, it rushes to bloom before it dies.\n            \n            Tracy Kelly, The Healthy Houseplant\n        \n\n        \n            \n                There is the same custom in literature as in Terra del Fuego. The young, growing men kill and eat the old. . . . The rising star shines always brighter than the setting, and the old must of their own will yield themselves up to be devoured by the young.\n            \n            Lev Shestov, Anton Tchekhov, and Other Essays\n        \n\n        \n            \n                As the Aegean, when those winds have died / Which only lately made it churn and leap, / Does not at once grow calm, or put aside / The roar and violence of the raging deep.\n            \n            Tasso (per Montaigne)\n        \n\n        \n            \n                Despite Freud's conviction that stored contents remain unaltered by time, I have come to believe that something does happen to them. Warmth finds its way into the cold storage vaults. In older age, the images become more pleasant. Arduous struggles, envious rivalries, even betrayals come back with a new valence. They don't hurt as much. The musing may even make them amusing. The long illness, the wrong marriage, all the slings and arrows of outrage lose their fire and forget their aim. Why do the dark days of the past lighten up in late recollection? Is it a subtle hint that the soul is letting go of the weights it has been carrying, preparing to lift off more easily? Is this a premonition of what religious traditions call heaven, this euphoric tone now coating many of the worst experiences, so that there is little left to forgive? At the end the unforgiveness will never be forgotten, because in old age they do not need to be forgiven: they have simply been forgotten. Forgetting, that marvel of the old mind, may actually be the truest form of forgiveness, and a blessing.\n            \n            James Hillman, The Force of Character and the Lasting Life\n        \n\n        \n            \n                By heaven, it is as proper to our age / To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions / As it is common for the younger sort / To lack discretion.\n            \n            Shakespeare, Hamlet\n        \n\n        \n            \n                Hamlet: [Speaking of Polonius] That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts. Rosencrantz: Happily [perhaps] he is the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child.\n            \n            Shakespeare, Hamlet\n        \n\n        \n            \n                [A] tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only tool that grows keener by constant use.\n            \n            Washington Irving, Rip Van Winkle\n        \n\n        \n            Back to Top\n            Back to Commonplace Book",

However much the writer might long to be, in his work, simple, honest, and straightforward, these virtues are no longer available to him. He discovers that in being simple, honest, and straightforward, nothing much happens: he speaks the speakable, whereas what we are looking for is the as-yet unspeakable, the as-yet unspoken. \n            \n            Donald Barthelme, Not Knowing\n        \n\n        \n            \n                Let us suppose that I am the toughest banjulele player in town and I have been contracted to play “Melancholy Baby” for six hours before an audience that will include the four next-toughest banjulele players in town. We imagine the smoky basement club, the hustling waiters (themselves students of the jazz banjulele) . . . forming a congenial group at the bar. There is one thing of which you may be sure: I am not going to play “Melancholy Baby” as written. Rather I will play something that is parallel, in some sense, to “Melancholy Baby,” having to do with “Melancholy Baby,” made out of “Melancholy Baby”—commentary, exegesis, elaboration, contradiction. The interest of my construction, if any, is located in the space between the new entity I have constructed and the “real” “Melancholy Baby,” which remains in the mind as the horizon which bounds my efforts.\n                This is, I think, the relation of art to the world. I suggest that art is always a meditation upon external reality rather than a representation of external reality or a jackleg attempt to “be” external reality.\n                ...\n\t\t\t\tStyle enables us to speak, to imagine again. Beckett speaks of “the long sonata of the dead”—where on earth did the word sonata come from, imposing as it does an orderly, even exalted design upon the most disorderly, distressing phenomenon known to us? The fact is not challenged, but understood, momentarily, in a new way. It's our good fortune to be able to imagine alternative realities, other possibilities. We can quarrel with the world, constructively...\n            \n            Donald Barthelme, Not Knowing\n        \n\n        \n            \n                1\n\t\t\t\t\n​\t\t\t\tThey take them out in the morning\n\t\t\t\tto the stone courtyard\n\t\t\t\tand put them against the wall\n\n\t\t\t\tfive men\n\t\t\t\ttwo of them very young\n\t\t\t\tthe other middle-aged\n\n\t\t\t\tnothing more\n\t\t\t\tcan be said about them\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\twhen the platoon\n\t\t\t\tlevel their guns\n\t\t\t\teverything suddenly appears\n\t\t\t\tin the garish light\n\t\t\t\tof obviousness\n\t\t\t\tthe yellow wall\n\t\t\t\tthe cold blue\n\t\t\t\tthe black wire on the wall\n\t\t\t\tinstead of a horizon\n\n\t\t\t\tthat is the moment\n\t\t\t\twhen the five senses rebel\n\t\t\t\tthey would gladly escape\n\t\t\t\tlike rats from a sinking ship\n\n\t\t\t\tbefore the bullet reaches its destination\n\t\t\t\tthe eye will perceive the flight of the projectile\n\t\t\t\tthe ear record the steely rustle\n\t\t\t\tthe nostrils will be filled with biting smoke\n\t\t\t\ta petal of blood will brush the palate\n\t\t\t\tthe touch will shrink and then slacken\n\n\t\t\t\tnow they lie on the ground\n\t\t\t\tcovered up to their eyes with shadow\n\t\t\t\tthe platoon walks away\n\t\t\t\ttheir button strap\n\t\t\t\tand steel helmets\n\t\t\t\tare more alive\n\t\t\t\tthan those lying beside the wall\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tI did not learn this today\n\t\t\t\tI knew this before yesterday\n\n\t\t\t\tso why have I been writing\n\t\t\t\tunimportant poems on flowers\n\n\t\t\t\twhat did the five talk of\n\t\t\t\tthe night before the execution\n\n\t\t\t\tof prophetic dreams\n\t\t\t\tof an escapade in a brothel\n\t\t\t\tof automobile parts\n\t\t\t\tof a sea voyage\n\t\t\t\tof how when he had spades\n\t\t\t\the ought to have opened\n\t\t\t\tof how vodka is best\n\t\t\t\tafter wine you get a headache\n\t\t\t\tof girls\n\t\t\t\tof fruit\n\t\t\t\tof life\n\n\t\t\t\tthus one can use in poetry\n\t\t\t\tnames of Greek shepherds\n\t\t\t\tone can attempt to catch the color of morning sky\n\t\t\t\twrite of love\n\t\t\t\tand also\n\t\t\t\tonce again\n\t\t\t\tin dead earnest\n\t\t\t\toffer to the betrayed world\n\t\t\t\ta rose\n            \n            Zbigniew Herbert, \"Five Men\" (trans.

Its nature could be summed up in a phrase ... : the grotesque is the estranged world. But some additional explanation is required. For viewed from the outside, the world of the fairy tale could also be regarded as strange and alien. Yet its world is not estranged, that is to say, the elements in it which are familiar and natural to us do not suddenly turn out to be strange and ominous. It is our world which has to be transformed. Suddenness and surprise are essential elements of the grotesque. In literature the grotesque appears in a scene or an animated tableau. Its representations in the plastic arts, too, do not refer to a state of repose but to an action, a “pregnant moment,” or at least—in the case of Kafka—a situation that is filled with ominous tension. . . . We are so strongly affected and terrified because it is our world which ceases to be reliable, and we feel that we would be unable to live in this changed world. The grotesque instills fear of life rather than fear of death. Structurally, it presupposes that the categories which apply to our world view become inapplicable. . . . [It is] the fusion of realms which we know to be separated, the abolition of the law of statics, the loss of identity, the distortion of “natural” size and shape, the suspension of the category of objects, the destruction of personality, and the fragmentation of the historical order.\n\t\t\t\tBut who effects the estrangement of the world, who announces his presence in this overwhelming ominousness? Only now do we plumb the final depth of the horror that is inspired by the transformed world. These questions remain unanswered. Apocalyptic beasts emerge from the abyss; demons intrude upon us. If we were able to name those powers and relate them to the cosmic order, the grotesque would lose its essential quality. . . . One could use another descriptive phrase and characterize the grotesque as the objectification of the “It,” the ghostly “It”—in contrast to the psychological “It” (it pleases me = I am glad) and the cosmic “It” (it rains)—the “It” which Ammann defined as the third meaning of the impersonal pronoun.\n\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\tThe grotesque is a play with the absurd. It may begin in a gay and carefree manner. ... But it may also carry the player away, deprive him of his freedom, and make him afraid of the ghosts which he so frivolously invoked. And now no helper comes to his rescue. The creators of grotesques have no advice that they can follow. ...\n\t\t\t\tIn many grotesques, little is to be felt of ... freedom and gaiety. But where the artistic creation has succeeded, a faint smile seems to pass rapidly across the scene or picture, and slight traces of the playful frivolity of the capriccio appear to be present. And there, but only there, another kind of feeling arises within us. In spite of all the helplessness and horror inspired by the dark forces which lurk in and behind our world and have power to estrange it, the truly artistic portrayal effects a secret liberation. The darkness has been sighted, the ominous places discovered, the incomprehensible forces challenged. And thus we arrive at a final interpretation of the grotesque: an attempt to invoke and subdue the demonic aspects of the world.\n            \n            ​Wolfgang Kayser, The Grotesque in Art and Literature\n        \n\n\t\t\n            \n\t\t\t[Watching the movie Blue Velvet by David Lynch] was my first hint that being a surrealist, or being a “weird” writer, didn't exempt you from certain responsibilities, but in fact it obligated and upped them—that whatever the project of surrealism is works way better if 99.9 percent of it is absolutely real. I mean, most of the word “surrealism” is “realism”; it's extra-realism, something on top of realism. It's that one thing in a Lynch frame that's off—that if everything else weren't picture perfect and totally structured, wouldn't hit.\n\t\t\t\n            ​David Foster Wallace, interview\n        \n\t\t\n\t\t\n            \n\t\t\tIt is the subject of willing, that is to say, his own will, which fills the consciousness of the lyrical author, often as a free and satisfied willing (joy), but much more often as a frustrated willing (sadness), and always as an emotion, a passion, a state of mind. Yet, alongside and at the same time as this state, the glances that the poet casts on the nature all around him make him aware of himself as a pure subject of knowledge, independent of willing, whose imperturbable spiritual peace contrasts with the desires of the ever-pressured, ever-greedy will: the feeling of this contrast, of this alternation, is expressed in the genre of lyric poems, and constitutes in short the lyrical state of mind. In this state, pure knowledge comes to us to deliver us from willing and its torments: we surrender ourselves to it, but only for a moment; ever and again the will, and the memory of our personal goals, comes to tear us away from peaceful contemplation; but again and again the beauty of our surroundings, through which a knowledge liberated from willing is offered to us, comes to seduce us. That is why, in song and lyrical inspiration, the will (self-interested and personal views) and the pure intuition of our surroundings are admirably mixed: reconciliations between the two are sought out and imagined; the subjective disposition of mind, the affection of willing, plays a part in the intuition of the surrounding world, and reciprocally lends its colours to it: the true lyric poem is the imprint of these mixed and shared states of mind.\n\t\t\t\n            Arthur Schopenhauer \n        \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIt is one of our problems that as we become crowded together, the sounds we make to each other, in our increasingly complex communication systems, become more random-sounding, accidental or incidental, and we have trouble selecting meaningful signals out of the noise. One reason is, of course, that we do not seem able to restrict our communication to information-bearing, relevant signals. Given any new technology for transmitting information, we seem bound to use it for great quantities of small talk. We are only saved by music from being overwhelmed by nonsense.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLewis Thomas, “The Music of This Sphere”\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIt is sometimes remarked, not by enemies of fiction but by people who love it, that whereas scientists and politicians work for progress, the writer of fiction restates what has always been known, finding new expressions for familiar truths, adapting to the age truths that may seem outmoded. ... But the fact remains that art produces the most important progress civilization knows. Restating old truths and adapting them to the age, applying them in ways they were never before applied, stirring up emotion by the inherent power of narrative, visual image, or music, artists crack the door to the morally necessary future.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tJohn Gardner, The Art of Fiction\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t[I]t is evident that a painted image—intangible by its very nature—hides nothing, while the tangibly visible object hides another visible thing—if we trust our experience.\n\t\t\tFor a time a curious priority has been accorded “the invisible,” owing to a confused literature, whose interest vanishes if we remember that the visible can be hidden, but the invisible hides nothing; it can be known or not known, no more. There is no reason to accord more importance to the invisible than to the visible, nor vice versa.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRené Magritte, letter to Michel Foucault (1966)\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe death of interpretation is to believe that there are signs, signs that exist primally, originally, really, as coherent, pertinent, and systematic marks. ... The life of interpretation, on the contrary, is to believe that there are only interpretations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMichel Foucault, This is Not a Pipe\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWe’re always rationally explaining and articulating things, but we’re at our most intelligent in the moment just before we start to explain or articulate. Great art occurs, or doesn’t, in that instant. What we turn to art for is precisely this moment when we know something, we feel it, but can’t articulate it because it’s too complex and multiple. But the knowing, in such moments, though happening without language, is real. I’d say this is what art is for. To remind us that this other sort of knowing is not only real, it’s superior to our usual, conceptual, reductive way.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGeorge Saunders, A Swim in a Pond in the Rain\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tA work of art moves us by being honest and that honesty is apparent in its language and its form and in its resistance to concealment.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGeorge Saunders, A Swim in the Pond in the Rain\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t​Cicero says, “It is certain that truth (by which he means nature) in everything, excels imitation; but if that were sufficient of itself in action, we should have no occasion for art.”\n\t\t\tIn his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better judge?) art, in this case, as well as in many others, if well managed, will assist and improve nature. But this is not all; for sometimes we find the force of it so great and powerful, that, where it is wholly counterfeit, it will for the time work the same effect as if it were founded in truth. This is well known to those who have been conversant with the representations of the theatre. In tragedies, though we are sensible that everything we see and hear is counterfeit; yet such is the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by it in the same manner as if it were all reality.\n\t\t\tAnger and resentment, at the appearance of cruelty, concern and solicitude for distressed virtue, rise in our breasts; and tears are extorted from us for oppressed innocence: though at the same time, perhaps, we are ready to laugh at ourselves for being thus decoyed.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCaleb Bingham, A.M., “General Instructions for Speaking”\n\t\t\n\n        \n            Back to Top\n            Back to Commonplace Book",
