            <blockquote>
                <p>As the automated pace of our daily jobs wipes out name and face&mdash;and, in many instances, feeling&mdash;there is a sacrilegious question being asked these days. To earn one’s bread by the sweat of one’s brow has always been the lot of mankind. At least, ever since Eden’s slothful couple was served with an eviction notice. The scriptural precept was never doubted, not out loud. No matter how demeaning the task, no matter how it dulls the senses and breaks the spirit, one <i>must</i> work. Or else.</p>
				
				<p>...</p>
				
				<p>Smug respectability, like the poor, we’ve had with us always. Today, however . . . such obtuseness is an indulgence we can no longer afford. The computer, nuclear energy for better or worse, and sudden, simultaneous influences flashed upon everybody’s TV screen have raised the ante and the risk considerably. Possibilities of another way, discerned by only a few before, are thought of&mdash;if only for a brief moment, in the haze of idle conjecture&mdash;by many today.</p>
				
				<p>...</p>
				
				<p>Is it any wonder that in such surreal circumstances, status rather than the work itself becomes important? Thus the prevalence of euphemisms in work as well as war. The janitor is a building engineer; the garbage man, a sanitary engineer; the man at the rendering plant, a factory mechanic; the gravedigger, a caretaker. They are not themselves ashamed of their work, but society, they feel, looks upon them as a lesser species. So they call upon a promiscuously used language to match the &ldquo;respectability&rdquo; of others, whose jobs may have less social worth than their own.</p>
				
				<p>...</p>
				
				<p>Perhaps it is this specter that most haunts working men and women: the planned obsolescence of people that is of a piece with the planned obsolescence of the things they make. Or sell. It is perhaps this fear of no longer being needed in a world of needless things that most clearly spells out the unnaturalness, the surreality of much that is called work today.</p>
				
				<p>...</p>
				
				<p>Perhaps it is time the &ldquo;work ethic&rdquo; was redefined and its idea reclaimed from the banal men who invoke it. In a world of cybernetics, of an almost runaway technology, things are increasingly making things. It is for our species, it would seem, to go on to other matters. Human matters.</p>
