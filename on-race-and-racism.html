            <blockquote>
                The Black body in anti-Black space is considered a disruption, and in some places, a violence. . . . It is a violence that is often mistaken for one <i>being violent</i>. Black people are not just subject to being hostages to time and death in their human mortality but also violences and other institutional racisms that can end Black life early. Black men feel nausea from the fear that they could be harmed or killed by police officers or civilians who see them as deviant. Black women carry the same nausea, coupled with their intersectional womanhood, which adds another complexity to their mortality. . . .
				<p>Black nausea is the feeling of stomaching fear and repurposing it for survival's sake. Sartre describes an experience of fear in the following way: &ldquo;behind the bush which has just moved there is someone hiding who is watching me.&rdquo; However, the interesting part about the bush, in Sartre's account, is that &ldquo; the bush [is] not the look; they only represent the eye. In themselves [the bush and the farmhouse] they are already eyes.&rdquo; The bush and farmhouse in the text are not <i>the look</i>, as Sartre describes it, but they are objects that continue to <i>see</i> agents. Black agents experience what it means to be considered the feared phenomenon behind the bushes and the feeling of <i>being seen</i> by the bushes, the feeling that the space itself is &ldquo;watching.&rdquo; Sartre gives us a working metaphor for how anti-Black spaces can <i>see</i> Black bodies in a particular way, and evoke Black nausea even when no one is around, or as he puts it, no one is looking out of the window of the farmhouse.</p>
