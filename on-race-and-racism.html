                <p>[Nineteenth-century] minstrelsy disguised whites and protected them from their own unacknowledged wishes. It also &ldquo;protected&rdquo; their society, a society held together by a mythology of racial difference. If it had been acknowledged that whites yearned to act like they thought African Americans acted, the foundation of the clearing would have been threatened.</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<p>One is moved to remember the social confusions of the nineteenth century. Whites used the minstrel stage to actually dip into, to embody, the particular mysteries of the forbidden, the African-American &ldquo;other.&rdquo; In response to the confusions and absences of the Victorian American self, mistrelsy was a technology of the self, an attempt <i>to heal</i> the white self of Victorian illnesses such as personal rigidity, loneliness, isolation, and lack of imagination, humor, and creativity. The emotional illnesses particular to the Victorian era, especially neurasthenia, were characterized by a lack of will and vitality, a kind of paralysis, brought about by the stresses and demands of white middle-class work, what physician George Beard in 1881 called &ldquo;brainwork.&rdquo; It is true that the minstrel character suffered from many problems, but none of them could have been considered neurasthenia. Whatever it was that went into the makeup of the minstrel's character, white neurasthenics could certainly have used a judicious dose or two. That is exactly what they received from the good Dr. Sambo.</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<p>Sambo was not the African American; he was the white man, or rather he embodied aspects of human living in which the white man could not partake. The white audience, so prim and proper, was never really laughing at the African American. It was ridiculing (and indulging in) its own inclinations and wishes, long denied, that were allowed to venture out only in the darkness of the minstrel stage.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The Black body in anti-Black space is considered a disruption, and in some places, a violence. . . . It is a violence that is often mistaken for one <i>being violent</i>. Black people are not just subject to being hostages to time and death in their human mortality but also violences and other institutional racisms that can end Black life early. Black men feel nausea from the fear that they could be harmed or killed by police officers or civilians who see them as deviant. Black women carry the same nausea, coupled with their intersectional womanhood, which adds another complexity to their mortality. . . .</p>
				<p>Black nausea is the feeling of stomaching fear and repurposing it for survival's sake. Sartre describes an experience of fear in the following way: &ldquo;behind the bush which has just moved there is someone hiding who is watching me.&rdquo; However, the interesting part about the bush, in Sartre's account, is that &ldquo; the bush [is] not the look; they only represent the eye. In themselves [the bush and the farmhouse] they are already eyes.&rdquo; The bush and farmhouse in the text are not <i>the look</i>, as Sartre describes it, but they are objects that continue to <i>see</i> agents. Black agents experience what it means to be considered the feared phenomenon behind the bushes and the feeling of <i>being seen</i> by the bushes, the feeling that the space itself is &ldquo;watching.&rdquo; Sartre gives us a working metaphor for how anti-Black spaces can <i>see</i> Black bodies in a particular way, and evoke Black nausea even when no one is around, or as he puts it, no one is looking out of the window of the farmhouse.</p>
