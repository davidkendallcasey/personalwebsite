            <blockquote>
				​Socrates [tells] a story of origins to Phaedrus. . . . that the ancient Egyptians had a divinity called Theuth, who discovered number, reckoning, geometry, astronomy, checkers and dice, and writing. Theuth brought these gifts to Thamus at Egyptian Thebes. Concerning writing, Socrates reports, Theuth said: &ldquo;O King, here is something that, once learned, will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memory; I have discovered a potion for memory and for wisdom.&rdquo; Thamus, however, replied, 
						<blockquote>
						. . . In fact, it will induce forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it: they will not practice using their memory because they will put their trust in writing . . . You have not discovered a potion for remembering, but for reminding; you provide your students with the appearance of wisdom, not with its reality. Your invention will enable them to hear many things without being properly taught, and they will imagine that they have come to know much while for the most part they will know nothing.

			<p><i>This quote, far from being a broad injunction against reading the written word (or of any newfangled technology, as Plato is often accused of making), is rather an injunction, first, against </i>merely<i> reading. That is, reading without recapitulating, passively reviewing the information of others as if one will somehow thereby come to own it; or reading without teaching, without transmitting the knowledge one has learned. Moreover, it is an injunction against the notion that mere </i>access<i> to information is equivalent to application of information. As Meinwald points out, the general public now has more access to &ldquo;medical&rdquo; information than ever before, for example, but this has not only not benefitted the public but in many ways has harmed it---thanks mostly to those who believe that medical information in the hands of just anyone, rather than someone who has spent decades utilizing and interpreting and understanding the nuance of that information, is just as good.</i></p>

        <div class="quote-entry" data-page-title="On Education">
            <blockquote>
				​The business of education is to give the student both useful information and life-enhancing experience, one largely measurable, the other not; and since the life-enhancing value of a course in literature is difficult to measure---since, moreover, many people in a position to put pressure on educational programs have no real experience in or feeling for the arts---it is often tempting to treat life-enhancement courses as course in useful information, putting them on the same &ldquo;objective&rdquo; level as courses in civics, geometry, or elementary physics. So it comes about that books are taught (officially, at least) not because they give joy, the incomparably rich experience we ask and expect of all true art, but because, as a curriculum committee might put it, they &ldquo;illustrate major themes in American literature,&rdquo; or &ldquo;present a clearly stated point of view and can thus serve as a vehicle for [various] curriculum objectives. . . .&rdquo; One cannot exactly say that such teaching is pernicious, but to treat great works of literature in this way seems a little like arguing for preservation of dolphins, whales, chimps, and gorillas solely on the grounds of ecological balance.
