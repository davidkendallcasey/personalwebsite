                Our path through life is strewn with many . . . sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavors.

                Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.

                <p>There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,<br>
				And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,<br>
				Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming<br>
				And humming sands, where windy surges wend:<br>
				And he called loudly to the stars to bend<br>
				From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they<br>
				Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:<br>
				And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend<br>
				Cried out, <i>Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!</i><br>
				The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,<br>
				Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.<br>
				And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,<br>
				Cried all his story to the dew drops glistening.<br>
				But naught they heard, for they are always listening.<br>
				And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend<br>
				Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,<br>
				And thought, <i>I will my heavy story tell<br>
				Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;<br>
				And my own tale again for me shall sing,<br>
				And my own whispering words will be comforting,<br>
				And lo! my ancient burden may depart.</i><br>
				Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;<br>
				But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone<br>
				Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan<br>
				Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.</p>

                The sole recourse usually is to the tenement where, heaped floor above floor, in a tainted atmosphere, or in low fetid hovels, amidst poverty, hunger and dirt, in foulness, want and crime, crowded humanity suffers, and sickens, and perishes; for the landlord here is also the air-lord, the lord of sunlight, lord of all the primary conditions of life and living; and these are doled out for a price, failing which the wretched tenant is turned out to seek a habitation still more miserable.
