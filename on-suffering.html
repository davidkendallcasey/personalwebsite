            <blockquote>
				<p>My mother's suffering grew into a symbol in my mind, gathering to itself all the poverty, the ignorance, the helplessness; the painful, baffling, hunger-ridden days and hours; the restless moving, the futile seeking, the uncertainty, the fear, the dread; the meaningless pain and the endless suffering. Her life set the emotional tone of my life, colored the men and women I was to meet in the future, conditioned my relation to events that had not yet happened, determined my attitude to situations and circumstances I had yet to face. A somberness of spirit that I was never to lose settled over me during the slow years of my mother's unrelieved suffering, a somberness that was to make me stand apart and look upon excessive joy with suspicion, that was to make me self-conscious, that was to make me forever on the move, as though to escape a nameless fate seeking to overtake me.</p>
				<p>At the age of twelve, before I had had one full year of formal schooling, I had a conception of life that no experience would ever erase, a predilection for what was real that no argument could ever gainsay, and sense of the world that was mine and mine alone, a notion as to what life meant that no education could ever alter, a conviction that the meaning of living came only when one was struggling to wring a meaning out of meaningless suffering.</p>
				<p>At the age of twelve I had an attitude toward life that was to endure, that was to make me seek those areas of living that would keep it alive, that was to make me skeptical of everything while seeking everything, tolerant of all and yet critical. The spirit I had caught gave me insight into the sufferings of others, made me gravitate toward those whose feelings were like my own, made me sit for hours while others told me of their lives, made me strangely tender and cruel, violent and peaceful.</p>
				<p>It made me want to drive coldly to the heart of every question and lay it open to the core of suffering I knew I would find there. It made me love burrowing into psychology, into realistic and naturalistic fiction and art, into those whirlpools of politics that had the power to claim the whole of men's souls. It directed my loyalties to the side of men in rebellion; it made me love talk that sought answers to questions that could help anybody, that could only keep alive in me that enthralling sense of wonder and awe in the face of the drama of human feeling which is hidden by the external drama of life.</p>

                How seldom a destiny<br>

				Because it's just as accurate with regard to bad things<br>
				as it is uncertain with regard to the good.<br>
				What a wonderful astrologer I would be<br>

				they would always come to pass!

                Our path through life is strewn with many . . . sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavors.

                Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.

                There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,<br>
				And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,<br>
				Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming<br>
				And humming sands, where windy surges wend:<br>
				And he called loudly to the stars to bend<br>
				From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they<br>
				Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:<br>
				And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend<br>
				Cried out, <i>Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!</i><br>
				The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,<br>
				Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.<br>
				And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,<br>
				Cried all his story to the dew drops glistening.<br>
				But naught they heard, for they are always listening.<br>
				And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend<br>
				Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,<br>
				And thought, <i>I will my heavy story tell<br>
				Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;<br>
				And my own tale again for me shall sing,<br>
				And my own whispering words will be comforting,<br>
				And lo! my ancient burden may depart.</i><br>
				Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;<br>
				But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone<br>
				Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan<br>
				Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.

                The sole recourse usually is to the tenement where, heaped floor above floor, in a tainted atmosphere, or in low fetid hovels, amidst poverty, hunger and dirt, in foulness, want and crime, crowded humanity suffers, and sickens, and perishes; for the landlord here is also the air-lord, the lord of sunlight, lord of all the primary conditions of life and living; and these are doled out for a price, failing which the wretched tenant is turned out to seek a habitation still more miserable.
