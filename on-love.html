			The young, the beautiful, the brave,<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lonely hope of Sestos&rsquo; daughter.<br>
			O, when alone along the sky<br>
			The turret-torchwas blazing high,<br>
			Though rising gale and breaking foam,<br>
			And shrieking sea-birds warned him home;<br>
			And clouds aloft and tides below,<br>
			With signs and sounds forbade to go,<br>
			He could not see, he would not hear<br>
			Or sound or sight foreboding fear.<br>
			His eye but saw that light of love,<br>
			The only star it hailed above;<br>
			His ear but rang with Hero's song,<br>
			&lsquo;Ye waves, divide not lovers long.&rsquo;<br>
			That tale is old, but love anew<br>
			May nerve young hearts to prove as true.</p>

                In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart.

            <blockquote>
                ​Rastignac and Delphine had met under the exact right circumstances for each to provide the other with the most intense pleasure. Their well-seasoned passion had been heightened by that which sometimes kills passion, namely, possession. For only in possessing this woman had Eugène [Rastignac] realized that, till then, he had simply desired rather than loved her: happiness had created love, since love is sometimes nothing more than the acknowledgement of pleasure. She might be infamous, she might be sublime, but for the delights of the flesh he had bought her as his dowry, and for those she had showered upon him, he adored this woman, just as Delphine loved him the way Tantalus would have loved an angel, coming to satisfy his hunger or quench the thirsting of his parched throat.

            <blockquote>
				Madame de Nucingen’s dreams had been deeply betrayed, the first time, and her faithfulness to a young egotist had earned her nothing. She had good reason to be mistrustful. Perhaps she could sense, in Eugène’s conduct towards her, a certain lack of respect, for his rapid rise had made him conceited . . . . Certainly, she wanted a man of his [young] age to find her imposing, and without any question she wanted to feel herself grand in comparison to him, having for so long felt herself small and insignificant in comparison to the man who had so recently abandoned her. She did not want Eugène to think her merely an easy conquest, precisely because, as she knew only too well, that was exactly how de Marsay [her estranged husband] had seen her. In short, having given herself to the degrading pleasures of someone young but virtually monstrous in his licentiousness, she was now tasting the sweetness of strolling in love’s flower-strewn regions, and finding it charming to relish everything she found there, listening slow and lingeringly, feeling herself softly caressed by chaste breezes.
				<p>Thus true love is forced to pay for the less satisfactory sort. This is bound to be a common reversal, so long as men refuse to understand how many flowers fall to the ground, in a young woman’s soul, as soon as deceit strikes.</p>

				She was walking on before him with Mr Bartell D'Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude but Gabriel's eyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his veins; and the thoughts were rioting through his brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous.
				<p>She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her. Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory. A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was caressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not eat for happiness.</p>

            <blockquote>
				I think the romantic love as we ordinarily conceive it requires the possibility of feeling gratitude, real, freedom-presupposing gratitude, gratitude that has not been deeply changed into a merely aesthetic feeling. . . . But I don’t actually think that romantic love, love for a specific individual rather than Christian love, general beneficence, requires the possibility of feeling gratitude. I think it’s the same as it was for Michel de Montaigne and his famous profound friendship with Etienne de la Boétie, who died young. When he was asked why their friendship was as it was, he simply said: &ldquo;Because it was him, because it was me.&rdquo; Same with love. This seems to me deep and true.
