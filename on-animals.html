                Being the owner of Dachshunds, to me a book on dog discipline becomes a volume of inspired humor. Every sentence is a riot. Some day, if I ever get a chance, I shall write a book, or warning, on the character and temperament of the Dachshund and why he can't be trained and shouldn't be. I would rather train a striped zebra to balance an Indian club than induce a Dachshund to heed my slightest command. When I address Fred I never have to raise either my voice or my hopes. He even disobeys me when I instruct him in something he wants to do.

                In a world with boundless opportunities for amusement, it's detestable that anyone would choose to get thrills from killing others who ask for nothing from life but the chance to remain alive. The animals whose lives [hunters have] so cold-heartedly snuffed out have precisely the same capacity to suffer as we do. All leave family members or mates behind when they're killed, and none is exempt from grief. . . . 
				<p>&ldquo;Sport&rdquo; hunting is a sickness, a perversion and a danger and should be recognized as such. People who get their &ldquo;amusement&rdquo; from hunting and killing defenceless animals can only be suffering from a mental disorder. We know that we should protect the most vulnerable and helpless in society, not destroy them&mdash;much less derive pleasure from doing so.</p>
