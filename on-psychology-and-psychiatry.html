                <p>I remember . . . a scene with Dr. Maynard, a session at his office, where I had told him in dramatic desperation, &ldquo;Doctor . . . I’m going mad; the final complete flip, it’s swooping down out of the hills at me!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He had only smiled, condescendingly and therapeutically. &ldquo;No, Leland, not you. You, and in fact quite a lot of your generation, have in some way been exiled from that particular sanctuary. It’s become almost impossible for you to &lsquo;go mad&rsquo; in the classical sense. At one time people conveniently &lsquo;went mad&rsquo; and were never heard from again. Like a character in a romantic novel. But now&rdquo;&mdash;And I think he even went so far as to yawn&mdash;&ldquo;you are too hip to yourself on a psychological level. You are all too intimate with too many of the symptoms of insanity to be caught completely off your guard. So . . . you may be neurotic as hell for the rest of your life, and miserable, maybe even do a short stint at Bellevue and certainly for another five years as a paying patient&mdash;but I’m afraid never completely out.&rdquo; He leaned back in his elegant Lounge-o-Chair. &ldquo;Sorry to disappoint you but the best I can offer is plain old schizophrenia with delusional tendencies.&rdquo;</p>

                To this day, in all of the reflective literature which aims at grasping the full reality of man, its superiority of content is offset by its incapacity for systematic presentation, ... [it] contains no apprehensible general system of mental life. We are tired of hearing that Lear, Hamlet, and Macbeth contain more psychology than all the psychological textbooks together. If only these art-fanatics would unveil for us the psychology wrapped up in such works! If we understand by psychology a description of the regular system of mental life, the works of the poets contain no psychology at all; ... but it is true that the way in which great writers and poets deal with human life presents psychology with a task and a material. Here is the intuitive understanding of the whole system which psychology too has to approach in its own way, by generalization and abstraction. One wishes for a psychology which could catch in the net of its descriptions that which these poets and writers contain over and above present-day psychology.

			<p>On Wilhelm Dilthey's philosophy of psychology:</p>
			<blockquote>
                Mental life is a functional unity which cannot be reduced to or built up theoretically out of non-functional units. ... The real unit of mental life is not a sensation, or a feeling, or even an isolated intentional act with its content, but a total reaction of the whole self to a situation confronting it. Every such reaction includes elements of three main types: cognitive, affective, and conative. ... The relations among the mind, and the possibility of a descriptive psyuchology rests on the fact that this structural system is not discovered by inference or hypothesis, but is actually experienced, or &ldquo;given in lived experience.&rdquo;

                The [study] designs [psychology has] been using ... are not&mdash;to borrow Morris's crisp term&mdash;sufficiently iconic with our subject matter. Addiction to machines, rats, or infants leads us to overplay those features of human behavior that are peripheral, signal-oriented, or genetic. Correspondingly it causes us to underplay those features that are central, future-oriented and symbolic.

            <blockquote>
                When, then, we talk of &ldquo;psychology as a natural science&rdquo; we must not assume that that means a sort of psychology that stands at last on solid ground. It means just the reverse; it means a psychology particularly fragile, and into which the waters of metaphysical criticism leak at every joint, a psychology all of whose elementary assumptions and data must be reconsidered in wider connections and translated into other terms. It is, in short, a phrase of diffidence, and not of arrogance, and it is indeed strange to hear people talk triumphantly of &ldquo;the New Psychology&rdquo; and write &ldquo;Histories of Psychology,&rdquo; when into the real elements and forces which the word covers not the first glimpse of clear insight exists. ... The matter of a science is with us. ... But at present psychology is in the condition of physics before Galileo and the laws of motion, of chemistry before Lavoisier and the notion that mass is preserved in all reactions. The Galileo and Lavoisier of psychology will be famous men indeed when they come. ... Meanwhile the best way in which we can facilitate their advent is to understand how great is the darkness in which we grope, and never to forget that the natural science assumptions with which we started are provisional and revisable things.
