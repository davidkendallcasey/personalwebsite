            <blockquote>
                The more uncertain you are that you are in control of things that matter in life, the more attracted you are to people who are just like you, the more rejecting you are of difference&mdash;gender difference, racial difference, ethnic difference. When the world seems certain to you, when you feel like you're in control, then you're more open to all these differences. But when the world seems uncertain, you want to, as it were, build a little world where everything is predicatble and everything is familiar. ... People are willing to submit to a certain amount of authoritarianism, not to make the trains run on time, but to make the world more predictable and make them feel more in control.

                If the human heart is inclined to stop and rest as it climbs the heights of affection, it rarely pauses on the rapid downward slopes of dislike.

                I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.

                For raging wind blows up incessant showers,<br>
                And when the rage allays, the rain begins.

                Remember: to hate, to be violent, is demeaning. It means you're afraid of other side of the coin&mdash;to love, and to be loved.
