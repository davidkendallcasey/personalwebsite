			<blockquote>
			The academic teaching about beauty is false. ... The beauties of the Parthenon, the Venuses, the Nymphs, the Narcissuses, are so many lies. Art is not the application of a canon of beauty, but what instinct and intellect can conceive independently of the canon. When one loves a woman one doesn't take instruments and measure her, one loves her with desire, and nevertheless everything has been done to introduce the canon even into love. To tell the truth the Parthenon is nothing but a farmhouse with a roof; colonnades and sculptures were added because in Athens there were people who worked and who wanted to express themselves.

            <blockquote>
                Despite having no arms the Venus of Milo is held up as an ideal of feminine beauty. Once she had arms, the story goes, then her arms were broken off; their loss only makes her beauty more poignant. Yet if it were discovered tomorrow that the Venus was in fact modelled on an amputee, she would be removed at once to a basement store. Why? Why can the fragmentary image of a woman be admired but not the image of a fragmentary woman, no matter how neatly sewn up the stumps?
