            <blockquote>
                With most books ... the author has <i>thought</i>, but not <i>perceived</i>; he has written from reflection, not from intuition. It is just this that makes them mediocre and wearisome. ... But where <i>a perception or intuition</i> was the basis of the author's thinking, it is as if he wrote it from a land where his reader has never been, for everything is fresh and new, since it is drawn directly from the primary source of all knowledge. ... <i>Perception</i> is not only the <i>source</i> of all knowledge, but is itself knowledge <i>par excellence</i>; it alone is the unconditionally true genuine knowledge, fully worthy of the name. For it alone imparts <i>insight</i> proper; it alone is actually assimilated by man, passes into his inner nature, and can quite justifiably be called <i>his</i>, whereas the concepts merely cling to him. ... For the man who studies to gain <i>insight</i>, books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him one step, he leaves it behind. One the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memories do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below for ever, since they are carrying what ought to have carried them.

                <p>The novel, in all its greatness, demands at least some passing notice of the classical unities, preserving that mysterious link between esthetics and moral fitness; but to have this unyielding antiquity exclude the newness in our ways of life would be regrettable. This newness is known to some of us through <i>Star Wars</i>, to some of us through the melancholy that follows a fielder’s error in the late innings of a ball game. In the pursuit of this newness, contemporary painting seems to have lost the language of the landscape, the still-life, and&mdash;most important&mdash;the nude. Modern music has been separated from those rhythms and tonalities that are most deeply ingrained in our memories, but literature still possesses the narrative&mdash;the story&mdash;and one would defend this with one’s life.</p>
				<p>In the short stories of my esteemed colleagues&mdash;and in a few of my own&mdash;I find those rented summer houses, those one-night love affairs, and those lost key rings that confound traditional esthetics. We are not a nomadic people, but there is more than a hint of this spirit of our great country&mdash;and the short story is the literature of the nomad.</p>

			As long as through the workings of laws and customs there exists a damnation-by-society [<i>la misère</i>] artificially creating hells in the very midst of civilization and complicating destiny, which is divine, with a man-made fate; as long as the three problems of the age are not resolved: the debasement of men through proletarianization, the moral degradation of women through hunger, and the blighting of children by keeping them in the darkness; as long as in certain strata social suffocation is possible; in other words and from an even broader perspective, as long as there are ignorance and poverty on earth, books of this kind may serve some purpose.

			​If no other knowledge deserves to be called useful but that which helps to enlarge our possessions or to raise our station in society, then mythology has no claim to the appellation. But if that which tends to make us happier and better can be called useful, then we claim the epithet for our subject. For mythology is the handmaid of good literature; and literature is one of the best allies of virtue and promoters of happiness.

			​​​Almost everything we do that is worth doing is done in the first place in the mind’s eye. The richness of human life is that we have many lives; we live the events that do not happen (and some that cannot) as vividly as those that do; and if we thereby die a thousand deaths, that is the price we pay for living a thousand lives.

            <blockquote>	
			​​However it may be achieved, in all great fiction, primary emotion (our emotion as we read, or the characters’ emotions, or some combination of both) must sooner or later lift off from the particular and be transformed to an expression of what is universally good in human life&mdash;what promotes happiness for the individual alone and in society; in other words, some statement on value. In good fiction, this universal statement is likely to be too subtle, too loaded with qualifications, to be expressed in any way but the story’s way; it may be impossible, that is, to reduce to any rule of behavior or general thesis. We <i>understand</i> the value, understand it with great precision, but even the shrewdest literary critic may have trouble formulating it in words and thus telling us the story’s &ldquo;message.&rdquo;

			I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed, and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects, that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. . . . The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinion of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.
