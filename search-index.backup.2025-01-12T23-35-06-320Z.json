    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Age As all the external sources of happiness and pleasure are, by their nature, highly uncertain, doubtful, ephemeral, and subject to chance, they dry up in certain circumstances; moreover, this is inevitable, as they cannot always be at hand. In old age, they almost all inevitable decline; for it is then that we are abandoned by love, banter, the pleasures of travelling and horse riding, as well as the aptitude to play a part in the world, and even by our friends and relatives who are taken from us by death. It is then, more than ever, that there returns the question of knowing what every man has for himself, because that is what will last the longest. Arthur Schopenhauer A man very often goes on living after he has completely lost the capacity of taking from life that wherein we are wont to see its essence and meaning. More striking still, a broken man is generally deprived of everything except the ability to acknowledge and feel his position. Nay, for the most part in such cases the intellectual abilities are refined and sharpened and increased to colossal proportions. It frequently happens that an average man, banal and mediocre, is changed beyond all recognition when he falls into the exceptional situation of [being close to death]. In him appear signs of a gift, a talent, even of genius. Nietzsche once asked: 'Can an ass be tragical?' He left his question unanswered, but Tolstoi answered for him in The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Ivan Ilyich . . . is a mediocre, average character, one of those men who pass through life avoiding anything that is difficult or problematical, caring exclusively for the calm and pleasantness of earthly existence. Hardly had the cold wind of tragedy blown upon him, than he was utterly transformed. The story of Ivan Ilyich in his last days is as deeply interesting as the life-story of Socrates or Pascal. Lev Shestov, Anton Tchekhov, and Other Essays While extreme stress can quickly kill a plant, small amounts of stress can trigger survival responses as the plant adapts to its environment. For example, outdoor plants that are exposed to lower water conditions can become hardier in the long run. In other words, the stress triggers the plant's survival instinct. For a rootbound plant, the response is a little different, though the motivation is the same. As the roots become more tightly contained within the planter, the Bird of Paradise will believe that it has reached the end of its growth potential and will respond accordingly. Why does that lead to flowering? Because, while we enjoy flowers for their beauty, blooms are actually how a plant propagates its species. Plants don't produce flowers under every kind of stress, in part because some forms of stress would make it difficult to produce blooms—such as dehydration or lack of light. But since an otherwise healthy Bird of Paradise doesn't know if it will survive the threat of crowding its roots, it rushes to bloom before it dies. Tracy Kelly, The Healthy Houseplant There is the same custom in literature as in Terra del Fuego. The young, growing men kill and eat the old. . . . The rising star shines always brighter than the setting, and the old must of their own will yield themselves up to be devoured by the young. Lev Shestov, Anton Tchekhov, and Other Essays As the Aegean, when those winds have died / Which only lately made it churn and leap, / Does not at once grow calm, or put aside / The roar and violence of the raging deep. Tasso (per Montaigne) Despite Freud's conviction that stored contents remain unaltered by time, I have come to believe that something does happen to them. Warmth finds its way into the cold storage vaults. In older age, the images become more pleasant. Arduous struggles, envious rivalries, even betrayals come back with a new valence. They don't hurt as much. The musing may even make them amusing. The long illness, the wrong marriage, all the slings and arrows of outrage lose their fire and forget their aim. Why do the dark days of the past lighten up in late recollection? Is it a subtle hint that the soul is letting go of the weights it has been carrying, preparing to lift off more easily? Is this a premonition of what religious traditions call heaven, this euphoric tone now coating many of the worst experiences, so that there is little left to forgive? At the end the unforgiveness will never be forgotten, because in old age they do not need to be forgiven: they have simply been forgotten. Forgetting, that marvel of the old mind, may actually be the truest form of forgiveness, and a blessing. James Hillman, The Force of Character and the Lasting Life By heaven, it is as proper to our age / To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions / As it is common for the younger sort / To lack discretion. Shakespeare, Hamlet Hamlet: [Speaking of Polonius] That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts. Rosencrantz: Happily [perhaps] he is the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child. Shakespeare, Hamlet [A] tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only tool that grows keener by constant use.

    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Art Art is not difficult because it wishes to be difficult, but because it wishes to be art. However much the writer might long to be, in his work, simple, honest, and straightforward, these virtues are no longer available to him. He discovers that in being simple, honest, and straightforward, nothing much happens: he speaks the speakable, whereas what we are looking for is the as-yet unspeakable, the as-yet unspoken. Donald Barthelme, Not Knowing Let us suppose that I am the toughest banjulele player in town and I have been contracted to play “Melancholy Baby” for six hours before an audience that will include the four next-toughest banjulele players in town. We imagine the smoky basement club, the hustling waiters (themselves students of the jazz banjulele) . . . forming a congenial group at the bar. There is one thing of which you may be sure: I am not going to play “Melancholy Baby” as written. Rather I will play something that is parallel, in some sense, to “Melancholy Baby,” having to do with “Melancholy Baby,” made out of “Melancholy Baby”—commentary, exegesis, elaboration, contradiction. The interest of my construction, if any, is located in the space between the new entity I have constructed and the “real” “Melancholy Baby,” which remains in the mind as the horizon which bounds my efforts. This is, I think, the relation of art to the world. I suggest that art is always a meditation upon external reality rather than a representation of external reality or a jackleg attempt to “be” external reality. ... Style enables us to speak, to imagine again. Beckett speaks of “the long sonata of the dead”—where on earth did the word sonata come from, imposing as it does an orderly, even exalted design upon the most disorderly, distressing phenomenon known to us? The fact is not challenged, but understood, momentarily, in a new way. It's our good fortune to be able to imagine alternative realities, other possibilities. We can quarrel with the world, constructively... Donald Barthelme, Not Knowing 1 ​ They take them out in the morning to the stone courtyard and put them against the wall five men two of them very young the other middle-aged nothing more can be said about them 2 when the platoon level their guns everything suddenly appears in the garish light of obviousness the yellow wall the cold blue the black wire on the wall instead of a horizon that is the moment when the five senses rebel they would gladly escape like rats from a sinking ship before the bullet reaches its destination the eye will perceive the flight of the projectile the ear record the steely rustle the nostrils will be filled with biting smoke a petal of blood will brush the palate the touch will shrink and then slacken now they lie on the ground covered up to their eyes with shadow the platoon walks away their button strap and steel helmets are more alive than those lying beside the wall 3 I did not learn this today I knew this before yesterday so why have I been writing unimportant poems on flowers what did the five talk of the night before the execution of prophetic dreams of an escapade in a brothel of automobile parts of a sea voyage of how when he had spades he ought to have opened of how vodka is best after wine you get a headache of girls of fruit of life thus one can use in poetry names of Greek shepherds one can attempt to catch the color of morning sky write of love and also once again in dead earnest offer to the betrayed world a rose Zbigniew Herbert, \"Five Men\" (trans. Czesław Miłoz & P.D. Scott) Go, lovely rose! Tell her that wastes her time and me That now she knows, When I resemble her to thee, How sweet and fair she seems to be. Tell her that's young, And shuns to have her graces spied, That hadst thou sprung In deserts, where no men abide, Thou must have uncommended died. Small is the worth Of beauty from the light retired; Bid her come forth, Suffer herself to be desired, And not blush so to be admired. Then die! that she The common fate of all things rare May read in thee; How small a part of time they share That are so wondrous sweet and fair! Edmund Waller (1606-1687), “Go, lovely rose!” Nothing is ordinary when submitted to a silent and sustained scrutiny. ​Julio Cortázar, The grotesque is a structure. Its nature could be summed up in a phrase ... : the grotesque is the estranged world. But some additional explanation is required. For viewed from the outside, the world of the fairy tale could also be regarded as strange and alien. Yet its world is not estranged, that is to say, the elements in it which are familiar and natural to us do not suddenly turn out to be strange and ominous. It is our world which has to be transformed. Suddenness and surprise are essential elements of the grotesque. In literature the grotesque appears in a scene or an animated tableau. Its representations in the plastic arts, too, do not refer to a state of repose but to an action, a “pregnant moment,” or at least—in the case of Kafka—a situation that is filled with ominous tension. . . . We are so strongly affected and terrified because it is our world which ceases to be reliable, and we feel that we would be unable to live in this changed world. The grotesque instills fear of life rather than fear of death. Structurally, it presupposes that the categories which apply to our world view become inapplicable. . . . [It is] the fusion of realms which we know to be separated, the abolition of the law of statics, the loss of identity, the distortion of “natural” size and shape, the suspension of the category of objects, the destruction of personality, and the fragmentation of the historical order. But who effects the estrangement of the world, who announces his presence in this overwhelming ominousness? Only now do we plumb the final depth of the horror that is inspired by the transformed world. These questions remain unanswered. Apocalyptic beasts emerge from the abyss; demons intrude upon us. If we were able to name those powers and relate them to the cosmic order, the grotesque would lose its essential quality. . . . One could use another descriptive phrase and characterize the grotesque as the objectification of the “It,” the ghostly “It”—in contrast to the psychological “It” (it pleases me = I am glad) and the cosmic “It” (it rains)—the “It” which Ammann defined as the third meaning of the impersonal pronoun. ... The grotesque is a play with the absurd. It may begin in a gay and carefree manner. ... But it may also carry the player away, deprive him of his freedom, and make him afraid of the ghosts which he so frivolously invoked. And now no helper comes to his rescue. The creators of grotesques have no advice that they can follow. ... In many grotesques, little is to be felt of ... freedom and gaiety. But where the artistic creation has succeeded, a faint smile seems to pass rapidly across the scene or picture, and slight traces of the playful frivolity of the capriccio appear to be present. And there, but only there, another kind of feeling arises within us. In spite of all the helplessness and horror inspired by the dark forces which lurk in and behind our world and have power to estrange it, the truly artistic portrayal effects a secret liberation. The darkness has been sighted, the ominous places discovered, the incomprehensible forces challenged. And thus we arrive at a final interpretation of the grotesque: an attempt to invoke and subdue the demonic aspects of the world. ​Wolfgang Kayser, The Grotesque in Art and Literature [Watching the movie Blue Velvet by David Lynch] was my first hint that being a surrealist, or being a “weird” writer, didn't exempt you from certain responsibilities, but in fact it obligated and upped them—that whatever the project of surrealism is works way better if 99.9 percent of it is absolutely real. I mean, most of the word “surrealism” is “realism”; it's extra-realism, something on top of realism. It's that one thing in a Lynch frame that's off—that if everything else weren't picture perfect and totally structured, wouldn't hit. ​David Foster Wallace, interview It is the subject of willing, that is to say, his own will, which fills the consciousness of the lyrical author, often as a free and satisfied willing (joy), but much more often as a frustrated willing (sadness), and always as an emotion, a passion, a state of mind. Yet, alongside and at the same time as this state, the glances that the poet casts on the nature all around him make him aware of himself as a pure subject of knowledge, independent of willing, whose imperturbable spiritual peace contrasts with the desires of the ever-pressured, ever-greedy will: the feeling of this contrast, of this alternation, is expressed in the genre of lyric poems, and constitutes in short the lyrical state of mind. In this state, pure knowledge comes to us to deliver us from willing and its torments: we surrender ourselves to it, but only for a moment; ever and again the will, and the memory of our personal goals, comes to tear us away from peaceful contemplation; but again and again the beauty of our surroundings, through which a knowledge liberated from willing is offered to us, comes to seduce us. That is why, in song and lyrical inspiration, the will (self-interested and personal views) and the pure intuition of our surroundings are admirably mixed: reconciliations between the two are sought out and imagined; the subjective disposition of mind, the affection of willing, plays a part in the intuition of the surrounding world, and reciprocally lends its colours to it: the true lyric poem is the imprint of these mixed and shared states of mind. Arthur Schopenhauer It is one of our problems that as we become crowded together, the sounds we make to each other, in our increasingly complex communication systems, become more random-sounding, accidental or incidental, and we have trouble selecting meaningful signals out of the noise. One reason is, of course, that we do not seem able to restrict our communication to information-bearing, relevant signals. Given any new technology for transmitting information, we seem bound to use it for great quantities of small talk. We are only saved by music from being overwhelmed by nonsense. Lewis Thomas, “The Music of This Sphere” It is sometimes remarked, not by enemies of fiction but by people who love it, that whereas scientists and politicians work for progress, the writer of fiction restates what has always been known, finding new expressions for familiar truths, adapting to the age truths that may seem outmoded. ... But the fact remains that art produces the most important progress civilization knows. Restating old truths and adapting them to the age, applying them in ways they were never before applied, stirring up emotion by the inherent power of narrative, visual image, or music, artists crack the door to the morally necessary future. John Gardner, The Art of Fiction [I]t is evident that a painted image—intangible by its very nature—hides nothing, while the tangibly visible object hides another visible thing—if we trust our experience. For a time a curious priority has been accorded “the invisible,” owing to a confused literature, whose interest vanishes if we remember that the visible can be hidden, but the invisible hides nothing; it can be known or not known, no more. There is no reason to accord more importance to the invisible than to the visible, nor vice versa. René Magritte, letter to Michel Foucault (1966) The death of interpretation is to believe that there are signs, signs that exist primally, originally, really, as coherent, pertinent, and systematic marks. ... The life of interpretation, on the contrary, is to believe that there are only interpretations. Michel Foucault, This is Not a Pipe We’re always rationally explaining and articulating things, but we’re at our most intelligent in the moment just before we start to explain or articulate. Great art occurs, or doesn’t, in that instant. What we turn to art for is precisely this moment when we know something, we feel it, but can’t articulate it because it’s too complex and multiple. But the knowing, in such moments, though happening without language, is real. I’d say this is what art is for. To remind us that this other sort of knowing is not only real, it’s superior to our usual, conceptual, reductive way. George Saunders, A Swim in a Pond in the Rain A work of art moves us by being honest and that honesty is apparent in its language and its form and in its resistance to concealment. George Saunders, A Swim in the Pond in the Rain ​Cicero says, “It is certain that truth (by which he means nature) in everything, excels imitation; but if that were sufficient of itself in action, we should have no occasion for art.” In his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better judge?) art, in this case, as well as in many others, if well managed, will assist and improve nature. But this is not all; for sometimes we find the force of it so great and powerful, that, where it is wholly counterfeit, it will for the time work the same effect as if it were founded in truth. This is well known to those who have been conversant with the representations of the theatre. In tragedies, though we are sensible that everything we see and hear is counterfeit; yet such is the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by it in the same manner as if it were all reality. Anger and resentment, at the appearance of cruelty, concern and solicitude for distressed virtue, rise in our breasts; and tears are extorted from us for oppressed innocence: though at the same time, perhaps, we are ready to laugh at ourselves for being thus decoyed.

    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Benevolence ​Whatever folly men commit, be their shortcomings or their vices what they may, let us exercise forbearance; remembering that when these faults appear in others, it is our follies and vices that we behold. They are the shortcomings of humanity, to which we belong; whose faults, one and all, we share; yes, even those very faults at which we now wax so indignant, merely because they have not yet appeared in ourselves. They are faults that do not lie on the surface. But they exist down there in the depths of our nature; and should anything call them forth, they will come and show themselves, just as we now see them in others. One man, it is true, may have faults that are absent in his fellow; and it is undeniable that the sum total of bad qualities is in some cases very large; for the difference of individuality between man and man passes all measure. In fact, the conviction that the world and man is something that had better not have been, is of a kind to fill us with indulgence towards one another. Nay, from this point of view, we might consider the proper form of address to be, not Monsieur, Sir, mein Herr, but my fellow-sufferer, Soci malorum, compagnon de miseres! This may perhaps sound strange, but it is in keeping with the facts; it puts others in a right light; and it reminds us of that which is after all the most necessary thing in life—the tolerance, patience, regard, and love of neighbor, of which everyone stands in need, and which, therefore, every man owes to his fellow. Arthur Schopenhauer, ``On the Sufferings of the World\" The worship of force, to which Carlyle and Nietzsche and the creed of militarism have accustomed us, is the result of failure to maintain our own ideals against a hostile universe; it is itself a prostrate submission to evil, a sacrifice of our best to Moloch. If strength indeed is to be respected, let us respect rather the strength of those who refuse that false ``recognition of facts\" which fails to recognize that facts are often bad. Let us admit that, in the world we know, there are many things that would be better otherwise, and that the ideals to which we do and must adhere are not realized in the realm of matter. Let us preserve our respect for truth, for beauty, for the ideal of perfection which life does not permit us to attain, though none of these things meets with the approval of the unconscious universe. If power is bad, as it seems to be, let us reject it from our hearts. In this lies man's true freedom: in determination to worship only the God created by our own love of the good, to respect only the heaven which inspires the insight of our best moments. In action, in desire, we must submit perpetually to the tyranny of outside forces; but in thought, in aspiration, we are free, free from our fellow men, free from the petty planet on which our bodies impotently crawl, free even, while we live, from the tyranny of death. Let us learn, then, that energy of faith which enables us to live constantly in the vision of the good; and let us descend, in action, into the world of fact, with that vision always before us. Bertrand Russell, ``A Free Man's Worship\" ​In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world. We have only our story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is. John Steinbeck, ``East of Eden\" ​You often say, ``I would give, but only to the deserving.\" The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture. They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish. Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and nights, is worthy of all else from you. And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream. And what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving? And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed? See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving. Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet [F]or the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.

It is possible to feel a certain indifference about the death penalty, not to declare yourself, to say yes and no, so long as you have not seen a guillotine with your own eyes. But if you do come across one, it has a violent impact. You are forced to make a decision, to take sides, for or against. . . . The guillotine is the law made concrete. Its name is retribution. It is not neutral and does not allow you to remain neutral. Whoever sees it shudders with the most mysterious of shudders. All social problems raise question marks around this blade. The scaffold is not a structure. The scaffold is not a machine. The scaffold is not an inert contraption made of wood, iron and rope. It is as though it were some kind of being with its own sinister initiative. To all appearances this wooden construction can see, this machine can hear, this contraption can understand, this wood, this iron and this rope have a will of their own. Its presence casts the soul into a ghastly trance in which the scaffold appears terrifying and involved in what it is doing. The scaffold is the executioner's accomplice. It devours. It eats flesh. It drinks blood. The scaffold is a kind of monster put together by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre that seems to live by some dreadful life force created out of all the death it has inflicted. Victor Hugo, Les Miserables (trans. Christine Donougher) Teach those who are ignorant as much as you can. Society is to blame for not giving free education. It’s responsible for the darkness it produces. In any benighted soul—that’s where sin will be committed. It’s not he who commits the sin that’s to blame but he who causes the darkness to prevail.

Shakespeare, Hamlet My fault is past, but, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn? ``Forgive me my foul murder”?

    "title": "On Culture - David Kendall Casey",
    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Culture In part, the contrast in the rate of change [between and among civilizations] is . . . that between Nature and Man as makers of change. Mankind increasingly chooses for itself, and even in prehistory the story of change is therefore increasingly one of conscious adaptation. . . . This is why the most important part of the human story is the story of consciousness; when, long ago, it broke the genetic slow march, it made everything else possible. Nature and nurture are there from the moment that human beings are first identifiable; perhaps they can never be quite disentangled, but man-made culture and tradition are increasingly the determinants of change. Two reflections ought, none the less, to be made to balance this indisputable fact. The first is that our species has almost certainly not shown any improvement in innate capacity since the Upper Palaeolithic. Human physique has not changed fundamentally in 40,000 years or so and it would be surprising if raw human mental capacity had done so. So short a time could hardly suffice for genetic changes comparable to those of earlier eras. The rapidity with which humanity has achieved so much since prehistoric times can be accounted for quite simply: there are many more of us upon whose talents humanity can draw and, more important still, human achievements are essentially cumulative. They rest upon a heritage itself accumulating at, as it were, compound interest. . . . If this is all speculative, the second reflection need not be: his genetic inheritance not only enables Homo sapiens to make conscious change, to undertake an unprecedented kind of evolution, but also controls and limits him. The irrationalities of the twentieth century show the narrow limits of our capacity for conscious control of our destiny. To this extent, we are still determined, still unfree, still a part of a nature which produced our unique qualities in the first place only by evolutionary selection. It is not easy to separate this part of our inheritance, either, from the emotional shaping the human psyche has received from the processes through which it is evolved. That shaping still lies deep at the heart of all our aesthetic and affective life. Man must live with an in-built dualism​. To deal with it has been the aim of most of the great philosophies and religions and the mythologies by which we still live, but they are themselves moulded by it. J.M. Roberts and O.A. Westad, The Penguin History of the World The dualism the authors mention here I interpret as inhering in: (1) our awareness of our cognitive and genetic limitations, that is, our inability to deal with the many complexities both that we have produced and in which we find ourselves; and (2), our capacity for conscious adaptation, for almost boundless imagination, for self-deification (which is arguably a product of the former two capacities), etc., such that we identify, as if simultaneously, as animals within and gods above the living world, and ultimate meaning must, we feel, be found in one or the other self- or collective conception (or else, much more difficult if not impossible, in both). [On the 19th-century American West] A nation of conquerors who submit themselves to living in the wilderness without ever letting themselves be seduced by its sweeter pleasures; whose only attachment to civilization and to the ideas of the Enlightenment is to whatever practical contributions they may be able to make to his well-being; who pushes himself into the solitudes of America with his ax and his papers. This is a people who, like all great peoples, has only one thought, and who pursues the acquisition of wealth, the sole object of its hard work, with a perseverance and scorn for life which might be called heroic if such a word could be applied to unvirtuous actions. It is this nomadic people that the great rivers and lakes do not stop in any way, before whom the forests fall and the prairies become shaded. It is this people who, after having touched the Pacific Ocean, will retrace its steps and disturb and destroy the society that has grown up in its wake. Alexis de Toqueville, A Fortnight in the Wilderness [Americans’] one primary and predominant object is to cultivate and settle these prairies, forests, and vast waste lands. The striking and peculiar characteristic of American society is, that it is not so much a democracy as a huge commercial company for the discovery, cultivation, and capitalization of its enormous territory. . . . The United States are primarily a commercial society . . . and only secondarily a nation. Emile Boutmy ​The new defines itself in response to what is already established; at the same time, the established has to reconfigure itself in response to the new. . . . Tradition counts for nothing when it is no longer contested and modified. A culture that is merely preserved is no culture at all. Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism ​You [Westerners] have neither the patience that weaves long lives, nor a feeling for the irregular, not a sense of the fittest place for a thing, nor a knowledge of government. You exhaust yourselves by endlessly re-beginning the work of the first day. So your ancestors are twice dead, and you . . . are afraid of death. In your land, power can do nothing. Your politics consist of changes of heart; it leads to general revolution, and then to reaction against revolution, which is another revolution. . . . For you, intelligence is not one thing among many. . . . You worship it as if it were an omnipotent beast. . . . A man intoxicated on it believes his own thoughts are legal decisions, or facts themselves born of the crowd and time. . . . You are in love with intelligence, until it frightens you. For your ideas are terrifying and your hearts are faint. Your acts of pity and cruelty are absurd, committed with no calm, as if they were irresistible. Finally, you fear blood more and more. Blood and time. . . . Yes, we men of these parts [the Far East] feed by continual millions in the most favorable valleys of the earth; and the depth of this immense sea of individuals has kept the form of a family, in an unbroken line from the earliest days. Every man here feels that he is both son and father, among thousands and tens of thousands, and is aware of being held fast by the people around him and the dead below him and the people to come, like brick in a brick wall. He holds. Every man here knows that he is nothing apart from this composite earth, and outside the miraculous structure of his ancestors. . . . You who know so many things, do not know the most ancient and powerful, and you rage with desire for what is immediate and you destroy your fathers and your sons together. . . . Here everything is a part of history: a certain flower, the sweetness of a turning moment, the delicate flesh of lakes laid bare by a sunbeam, a stirring eclipse. In these things the spirits of our fathers meet our own. Things reproduce themselves, and as we repeat the sounds they gave them for names, we are joined by memory to our fathers and made eternal. . . . We do not wish to know too much. Men's knowledge must not increase endlessly. If it continues to expand, it causes endless trouble, and despairs of itself. If it halts, decadence sets in. . . . And now remember that your great inventions had their origin with us. Do you understand now why we did not develop them further? To have singled them out for development would have spoiled the slow grandeur of our existence by disturbing the simple regularity of its course. You can see that we are not to be despised: we invented gunpowder—but for shooting off fireworks in the evening. Paul Valéry (writing in the fictional character of a Chinese scholar), ``The Yalu\" An Orwellian world is much easier to recognize and to oppose than a Huxleyan. Everything in our background has prepared us to know and to resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us. . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse devolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture’s being drained by laughter? Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death Back to Top Back to Commonplace Book",
