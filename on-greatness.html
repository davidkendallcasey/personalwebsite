            <blockquote>
                It is disconcerting to find that the saviour of his country may be stingy or that the poet who has opened new horizons to our consciousness may be a snob. Our natural egoism leads us to judge people by their relations to ourselves. We want them to be certain things to us, and for us that is what they are; because the rest of them is no good to us, we ignore it.
				<p>These reasons perhaps explain why there is so great a disinclination to accept the attempts to portray man with his incongruous and diverse qualities and why people turn away with dismay when candid biographers reveal the truth about famous persons. It is distressing to think that the composer of the quintet in the Meistersinger was dishonest in money matters and treacherous to those who had benefited him. But it may be that he could not have had great qualities if he had not also had great failings. I do not believe they are right who say that the defects of famous men should be ignored; I think it is better that we should know them. Then, though we are conscious of having faults as glaring as theirs, we can believe that this is no hindrance to our achieving also something of their virtues.</p>

			<p><i>I would add that, likewise, we must accept that even the worst villains of history may have possessed noble qualities&mdash;that Hitler was an ethical vegan, for instance, or was fond of German Shepherds&mdash;lest we believe that our own noble qualities necessarily constrain our capacity for evil (Cf. Arendt on the “banality of evil”).</i></p>

​				The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;<br>
				The obscene ravens, clamorous o’er the dead;<br>
				The vultures, to the conqueror’s banner true,<br>
				Who feed where Desolation first has fed,<br>
				And whose wings rain contagion: how they fled,<br>
				When like Apollo, from his golden bow,<br>
				The Phythian of the age one arrow sped<br>
				And smiled! The spoilers tempt no second blow;<br>
				They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them as they go.<br>
