            <blockquote>
                There is something nightmarish about the scaffold when it is standing there ready. It is possible to feel a certain indifference about the death penalty, not to declare yourself, to say yes and no, so long as you have not seen a guillotine with your own eyes. But if you do come across one, it has a violent impact. You are forced to make a decision, to take sides, for or against. . . . The guillotine is the law made concrete. Its name is retribution. It is not neutral and does not allow you to remain neutral. Whoever sees it shudders with the most mysterious of shudders. All social problems raise question marks around this blade. The scaffold is not a structure. The scaffold is not a machine. The scaffold is not an inert contraption made of wood, iron and rope. It is as though it were some kind of being with its own sinister initiative. To all appearances this wooden construction can see, this machine can hear, this contraption can understand, this wood, this iron and this rope have a will of their own. Its presence casts the soul into a ghastly trance in which the scaffold appears terrifying and involved in what it is doing. The scaffold is the executioner's accomplice. It devours. It eats flesh. It drinks blood. The scaffold is a kind of monster put together by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre that seems to live by some dreadful life force created out of all the death it has inflicted.

			. . .When thoughts of the last bitter hour come like a blight<br>
			Over thy spirit, and sad images<br>
			Of stern agony, and shroud, and pall,<br>
			And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,<br>
			Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;&mdash;<br>
			Go forth under the open sky, and list<br>
			To Nature's teachings, while from all around&mdash;<br>
			Earth and her waters, and the depths of air,&mdash;<br>
			​Comes a still voice&mdash;Yet a few days, and thee<br>
			The all-beholding sun shall see no more<br>
			In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,<br>
			Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,<br>
			Nor in the embrace of ocean shall exist<br>
			Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim<br>
			Thy growth, to be resolv'd to earth again;<br>
			And, lost each human trace, surrend'ring up<br>
			Thine individual being, shalt thou go<br>
			To mix forever with the elements,<br>
			To be a brother to th' insensible rock<br>
			And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain<br>
			Turns with his share, and treads upon.<br>
			<p>. . .</p>
			<p>Yet not to thy eternal resting place<br>
			Shalt thou retire alone&mdash;nor couldst thou wish<br>
			Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down<br>
			​With patriarchs of the infant world&mdash;with kings,<br>
			The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good,<br>
			Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,<br>
			All in one mighty sepulchre.<br></p>
			<p>. . .</p>
			<p>. . . All that breathe<br>
			Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh<br>
			When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care<br>
			Plod on, and each one as before will chase<br>
			His favourite phantom; yet all these shall leave<br>
			Their mirth and their employments, and shall come,<br>
			And make their bed with thee. As the long train<br>
			Of ages glide away, the sons of men,<br>
			The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes<br>
			In the full strength of years, matron, and maid,<br>
			The bow'd with age, the infant in the smiles<br>
			And beauty of its innocent age cut off,&mdash;<br>
			Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,<br>
			By those, who in their turn shall follow them.<br>
			So live, that when thy summons comes to join<br>
			The innumerable caravan, that moves<br>
			To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take<br>
			His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br>
			Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,<br>
			Scourged to his dungeon, but sustain'd and sooth'd<br>
			By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,<br>
			Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch<br>
			​About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.<br></p>

				In a cradle doth receive us,<br>
				Leaving us securely lain<br>
				In its open arms: but should it,<br>

				In the world's confused abyss,<br>
				Sickness ever leads to this,<br>
				When death strikes the fatal blow.<br>
				Man, be mindful, here below,<br>
				Of thy soul's sublimer part;<br>
				Think upon eternity,<br>
				Wait not till infirmity<br>
				Suddenly that truth impart&mdash;<br>
				For infirmity itself thou art.<br>
				On the hard earth, year by year,<br>
				Man in treading, hopeful, brave,<br>
				But each step is o'er his grave,<br>
				Daily drawing near and near.<br>
				Mournful sentence&mdash;law severe&mdash;<br>
				But which cannot be mistaken,<br>
				Every step (what fears awaken!)<br>
				Is to that dark goal commissioned,<br>
				So that God is not sufficient<br>
				To prevent that step being taken . . .<br></p>

                In the depths of his soul Ivan Ilyich knew that he was dying, but not only was he not accustomed to it, he simply did not, he could not possibly understand it.
				<p>The example of a syllogism he had studied in Kiesewetter's logic&mdash;Caius is a man, men are mortal, therefore Caius is mortal&mdash;had seemed to him all his life to be correct only in relation to Caius, but by no means to himself. For the man Caius, man in general, it was perfectly correct; but he was not Caius and not man in general, he had always been quite, quite separate from all other beings; he was Vanya, with mamá, with papá, with Mitya and Volodya, with toys, the coachman, with a nanny, then with Katenka, with all the joys, griefs, and delights of childhood, boyhood, and youth. Was it for Caius, the smell of the striped leather ball that Vanya had loved so much? Was it Caius who had kissed his mother's hand like that, and was it for Caius that the silk folds of his mother's dress had rustled like that? Was it he who had mutinied against bad food in law school? Was it Caius who had been in love like that? Was it Caius who could conduct a court session like that?</p>
				<p>And Caius is indeed mortal, and it is right that he die, but for me, Vanya, Ivan Ilyich, with all my feelings and thoughts&mdash;for me it is another matter. And it cannot be that I should die. It would be too terrible.</p>
				<p>So it felt to him.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If I was to die, like Caius, I would have known it, my inner voice would have told me so, but there was nothing of the sort in me; and I and all my friends understood that things were quite otherwise than with Caius. And now look!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;It can't be. It can't be, but it is. How can it be? How can I understand it?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>And he could not understand and tried to drive this thought away as false, incorrect, morbid, and to dislodge it with other correct, healthy thoughts. But this thought, not only a thought but as if a reality, came back again and stood before him.</p>
				<p>And he called up a series of other thoughts in place of this thought, in hopes of finding support in them. He tried to go back to his former ways of thinking, which had screened him formerly from the thought of death. But&mdash;strange thing&mdash;all that had formerly screened, hidden, wiped out the consciousness of death now could no longer produce that effect. . . .</p>
				<p>And what was worst of all was that <i>it</i> drew him to itself not so that he would do something, but only so that he should look at it straight in the eye, look at it and, doing nothing, suffer inexpressibly.
				And to save himself from this state, Ivan Ilyich looked for consolation, for other screens, and other screens appeared and for a short time seemed to save him, but at once they were again not so much destroyed as made transparent, as if <i>it</i> penetrated everything and there was no screening it out. . . .</p>
				<p>He would go to his study, lie down, and again remain alone with <i>it</i>. Face to face with <i>it</i>, and there was nothing to be done with <i>it</i>. Only look at <i>it</i> and go cold.</p>

                To chime the notes of his emotion, a verse mysteriously entered the correspondent's head. He had even forgotten that he had forgotten this verse, but it suddenly was in his mind.
				<p><i>A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,<br>
				There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's tears,<br>
				But a comrade stood beside him, and he took that comrade's hand,<br>
				And he said: &lsquo;I never more shall see my own, my native land.&rsquo;</i></p>
				<p>In his childhood, the correspondent had been made acquainted with the fact that a soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, but he had never regarded it as important. Myriads of his school-fellows had informed him of the soldier's plight, but the dinning had naturally ended by making him perfectly indifferent. He had never considered it his affair that a soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, nor had it appeared to him as a matter for sorrow. It was less to him than the breaking of a pencil's point.</p>
				Now, however, it quaintly came to him as a human, living thing. It was no longer merely a picture of a few throes in the breast of a poet, meanwhile drinking tea and warming his feet at the grate; it was an actuality&mdash;stern, mournful, and fine.

                Long ago has been told the Eastern story about the traveller who in the steppe is overtaken by an infuriated beast. Trying to save himself from the animal, the traveller jumps into a waterless well, but at its bottom he sees a dragon who opens his jaws in order to swallow him. And the unfortunate man does not dare climb out, lest he perish from the infuriated beast, and does not dare jump down to the bottom of the well, lest he be devoured by the dragon, and so clutches the twig of a wild bush growing in a cleft of the well and holds on to it. His hands grow weak and he feels that soon he shall have to surrender to the peril which awaits him at either side; but he still holds on and sees two mice, one white, the other black, in even measure making at it on all sides. Now, at any moment, the bush will break and tear off, and he will fall into the dragon's jaws. The traveller sees that and knows that he will inevitably perish; but while he is still clinging, he sees some drops of honey hanging on the leaves of the bush, and so reaches out for them with his tongue and licks the leaves. Just so I hold on to the branch of life, knowing that the dragon of death is waiting inevitably for me, ready to tear me to pieces, and I cannot understand why I have fallen on such suffering. And I try to lick the honey which used to give me pleasure; but now it no longer gives me joy, and the white and the black mouse day and night nibble at the branch to which I am holding on. . . . I see only the inevitable dragon and the mice, and am unable to turn my glance away from them. This is not a fable, but a veritable, indisputable, comprehensible truth.
