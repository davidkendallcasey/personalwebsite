            <blockquote>
                [M. Waldman] heard with attention my little narration concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, &ldquo;these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.&rdquo;

                ​In seeking absolute truth we aim at the unattainable, and must be content with finding broken portions. . . . [B]ut each one of us may pick up a fragment, perhaps two, and in moments when mortality weighs less heavy upon the spirit, we can, as in a vision, see the form divine, just as a great Naturalist . . . can reconstruct an ideal creature from a fossil fragment.
