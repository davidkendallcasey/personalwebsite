            <blockquote>
                With most books ... the author has <i>thought</i>, but not <i>perceived</i>; he has written from reflection, not from intuition. It is just this that makes them mediocre and wearisome. ... But where <i>a perception or intuition</i> was the basis of the author's thinking, it is as if he wrote it from a land where his reader has never been, for everything is fresh and new, since it is drawn directly from the primary source of all knowledge. ... <i>Perception</i> is not only the <i>source</i> of all knowledge, but is itself knowledge <i>par excellence</i>; it alone is the unconditionally true genuine knowledge, fully worthy of the name. For it alone imparts <i>insight</i> proper; it alone is actually assimilated by man, passes into his inner nature, and can quite justifiably be called <i>his</i>, whereas the concepts merely cling to him. ... For the man who studies to gain <i>insight</i>, books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him one step, he leaves it behind. One the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memories do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below for ever, since they are carrying what ought to have carried them.

            <blockquote>
                To perceive, to allow the things themselves to speak to us, to apprehend and grasp new relations between them, and then to precipitate and deposit all this into new concepts, in order to possess it with certainty; this is what gives us new knowledge. ... The innermost kernel of every genuine and actual piece of knowledge is a perception; every new truth is also the fruit of such a perception. ... If we go to the bottom of the matter, all truth and wisdom, in fact the ultimate secret of things, is contained in everything actual, yet certainly only <i>in concreto</i> and like gold hidden in the ore. The question is how to extract it.

            <blockquote>
                [M. Waldman] heard with attention my little narration concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, &ldquo;these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.&rdquo;

                ​In seeking absolute truth we aim at the unattainable, and must be content with finding broken portions. . . . [B]ut each one of us may pick up a fragment, perhaps two, and in moments when mortality weighs less heavy upon the spirit, we can, as in a vision, see the form divine, just as a great Naturalist . . . can reconstruct an ideal creature from a fossil fragment.
