                <p>The human reason discovers new relations between things not by deduction, but by that unpredictable blend of speculation and insight that scientists call induction, which&mdash;like other forms of imagination&mdash;cannot be formalized.</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<p>The test of imagination is experience. But then, that is as true of literature and the arts as it is of science. In science, the imaginary experiment is tested by confronting it with physical experience; and in literature, the imaginative conception is tested by confronting it with human experience. The superficial speculation in science is dismissed because it is found to falsify nature; and the shallow work of art is discarded because it is found to be untrue to our own nature. ... The strength of the imagination, its enriching power and excitement, lies in its interplay with reality&mdash;physical and emotional.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The seventeenth century was heady with new dreams and fables about voyages to the moon. ... They did not draw a line between science and fancy; for example, they all tried to guess just where in the journey the earth's gravity would stop. Only Kepler understood that gravity has no boundary, and put a law to it&mdash;which happened to be the wrong law.</p>
				<p>All this was a few years before Isaac Newton was born, and it was all in his head that day in 1666 when he sat in his mother's garden, a young man of twnety-three, and thought about the reach of gravity. This was how he came to conceive his brilliant image, that the moon is like a ball which has been thrown so hard that it falls exactly as fast as the horizon, all the way round the earth. The image will do for any satellite, and Newton modestly calculated how long therefore an astronaut would take to fall round the earth once. He made it ninety minutes, and we have all seen now that he was right; but Newton had no way to check that. Instead he went on to calculate how long in that case the distant moon would take to round the earth, if indeed it behaves like a thrown ball that falls in the earth's gravity, and if gravity obeyed a law of inverse squares. He found that the answer would be twenty-eight days.</p>
				<p>In that telling figure, the imagination that day chimed with nature, and made a harmony.</p>

            <blockquote>
                With most books ... the author has <i>thought</i>, but not <i>perceived</i>; he has written from reflection, not from intuition. It is just this that makes them mediocre and wearisome. ... But where <i>a perception or intuition</i> was the basis of the author's thinking, it is as if he wrote it from a land where his reader has never been, for everything is fresh and new, since it is drawn directly from the primary source of all knowledge. ... <i>Perception</i> is not only the <i>source</i> of all knowledge, but is itself knowledge <i>par excellence</i>; it alone is the unconditionally true genuine knowledge, fully worthy of the name. For it alone imparts <i>insight</i> proper; it alone is actually assimilated by man, passes into his inner nature, and can quite justifiably be called <i>his</i>, whereas the concepts merely cling to him. ... For the man who studies to gain <i>insight</i>, books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him one step, he leaves it behind. One the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memories do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below for ever, since they are carrying what ought to have carried them.

            <blockquote>
                To perceive, to allow the things themselves to speak to us, to apprehend and grasp new relations between them, and then to precipitate and deposit all this into new concepts, in order to possess it with certainty; this is what gives us new knowledge. ... The innermost kernel of every genuine and actual piece of knowledge is a perception; every new truth is also the fruit of such a perception. ... If we go to the bottom of the matter, all truth and wisdom, in fact the ultimate secret of things, is contained in everything actual, yet certainly only <i>in concreto</i> and like gold hidden in the ore. The question is how to extract it.

                [M. Waldman] heard with attention my little narration concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, &ldquo;these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.&rdquo;

                ​In seeking absolute truth we aim at the unattainable, and must be content with finding broken portions. . . . [B]ut each one of us may pick up a fragment, perhaps two, and in moments when mortality weighs less heavy upon the spirit, we can, as in a vision, see the form divine, just as a great Naturalist . . . can reconstruct an ideal creature from a fossil fragment.
