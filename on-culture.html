            <blockquote>
                <p>In part, the contrast in the rate of change [between and among civilizations] is . . . that between Nature and Man as makers of change. Mankind increasingly <i>chooses for itself</i>, and even in prehistory the story of change is therefore increasingly one of conscious adaptation. . . . This is why the most important part of the human story is the story of consciousness; when, long ago, it broke the genetic slow march, it made everything else possible. Nature and nurture are there from the moment that human beings are first identifiable; perhaps they can never be quite disentangled, but man-made culture and tradition are increasingly the determinants of change.</p>
				<p>Two reflections ought, none the less, to be made to balance this indisputable fact. The first is that our species has almost certainly not shown any improvement in innate capacity since the Upper Palaeolithic. Human physique has not changed fundamentally in 40,000 years or so and it would be surprising if raw human mental capacity had done so. So short a time could hardly suffice for genetic changes comparable to those of earlier eras. The rapidity with which humanity has achieved so much since prehistoric times can be accounted for quite simply: there are many more of us upon whose talents humanity can draw and, more important still, human achievements are essentially cumulative. They rest upon a heritage itself accumulating at, as it were, compound interest. . . .</p>
				If this is all speculative, the second reflection need not be: his genetic inheritance not only enables <i>Homo sapiens</i> to make conscious change, to undertake an unprecedented kind of evolution, but also controls and limits him. The irrationalities of the twentieth century show the narrow limits of our capacity for conscious control of our destiny. To this extent, we are still determined, still unfree, still a part of a nature which produced our unique qualities in the first place only by evolutionary selection. It is not easy to separate this part of our inheritance, either, from the emotional shaping the human psyche has received from the processes through which it is evolved. That shaping still lies deep at the heart of all our aesthetic and affective life. <i>Man must live with an in-built dualism​</i>. To deal with it has been the aim of most of the great philosophies and religions and the mythologies by which we still live, but they are themselves moulded by it.

		The <i>dualism</i> the authors mention here I interpret as inhering in: (1) our awareness of our cognitive and genetic limitations, that is, our inability to deal with the many complexities both that we have produced and in which we find ourselves; and (2), our capacity for conscious adaptation, for almost boundless imagination, for self-deification (which is arguably a product of the former two capacities), etc., such that we identify, as if simultaneously, as animals within and gods above the living world, and ultimate meaning must, we feel, be found in one or the other self- or collective conception (or else, much more difficult if not impossible, in both).</p>

                <p>[On the 19th-century American West]</p>
				A nation of conquerors who submit themselves to living in the wilderness without ever letting themselves be seduced by its sweeter pleasures; whose only attachment to civilization and to the ideas of the Enlightenment is to whatever practical contributions they may be able to make to his well-being; who pushes himself into the solitudes of America with his ax and his papers. This is a people who, like all great peoples, has only one thought, and who pursues the acquisition of wealth, the sole object of its hard work, with a perseverance and scorn for life which might be called heroic if such a word could be applied to unvirtuous actions. It is this nomadic people that the great rivers and lakes do not stop in any way, before whom the forests fall and the prairies become shaded. It is this people who, after having touched the Pacific Ocean, will retrace its steps and disturb and destroy the society that has grown up in its wake.

                [Americans’] one primary and predominant object is to cultivate and settle these prairies, forests, and vast waste lands. The striking and peculiar characteristic of American society is, that it is not so much a democracy as a huge commercial company for the discovery, cultivation, and capitalization of its enormous territory. . . . The United States are primarily a commercial society . . . and only secondarily a nation.

                ​The new defines itself in response to what is already established; at the same time, the established has to reconfigure itself in response to the new. . . .

                ​<p>You [Westerners] have neither the patience that weaves long lives, nor a feeling for the irregular, not a sense of the fittest place for a thing, nor a knowledge of government. You exhaust yourselves by endlessly re-beginning the work of the first day. So your ancestors are twice dead, and you . . . are afraid of death.</p>
				<p>In your land, power can do nothing. Your politics consist of changes of heart; it leads to general revolution, and then to reaction against revolution, which is another revolution. . . .</p>
				<p>For you, intelligence is not one thing among many. . . . You worship it as if it were an omnipotent beast. . . . A man intoxicated on it believes his own thoughts are legal decisions, or facts themselves born of the crowd and time. . . . You are in love with intelligence, until it frightens you. For your ideas are terrifying and your hearts are faint. Your acts of pity and cruelty are absurd, committed with no calm, as if they were irresistible. Finally, you fear blood more and more. Blood and time. . . .</p>
				<p>Yes, we men of these parts [the Far East] feed by continual millions in the most favorable valleys of the earth; and the depth of this immense sea of individuals has kept the form of a family, in an unbroken line from the earliest days. Every man here feels that he is both son and father, among thousands and tens of thousands, and is aware of being held fast by the people around him and the dead below him and the people to come, like brick in a brick wall. He holds. Every man here knows that he is nothing apart from this composite earth, and outside the miraculous structure of his ancestors. . . .</p>
				<p>You who know so many things, do not know the most ancient and powerful, and you rage with desire for what is immediate and you destroy your fathers and your sons together. . . . Here everything is a part of history: a certain flower, the sweetness of a turning moment, the delicate flesh of lakes laid bare by a sunbeam, a stirring eclipse. In these things the spirits of our fathers meet our own. Things reproduce themselves, and as we repeat the sounds they gave them for names, we are joined by memory to our fathers and made eternal. . . .</p>
				We do not wish to know too much. Men's knowledge must not increase endlessly. If it continues to expand, it causes endless trouble, and despairs of itself. If it halts, decadence sets in. . . . And now remember that your great inventions had their origin with us. Do you understand now why we did not develop them further? To have singled them out for development would have spoiled the slow grandeur of our existence by disturbing the simple regularity of its course. You can see that we are not to be despised: we invented gunpowder—but for shooting off fireworks in the evening.

                An Orwellian world is much easier to recognize and to oppose than a Huxleyan. Everything in our background has prepared us to know and to resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us. . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse devolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture’s being drained by laughter?
