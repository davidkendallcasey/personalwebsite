                The images [in imagination&mdash;what could be called <i>imaginalia</i>] play out for us events which are not present to our senses, and thereby guard the past and create the future&mdash;a future that does not yet exist, and may never come to exist in that form. By contrast, the lack of symbolic ideas, or their rudimentary poverty, cuts off an animal from the past and the future alike, and imprisons him in the present. Of all the distinctions between man and animal, the characteristic gift which makes us human is the power to work with symbolic images: the gift of imagination.

		Although I do believe some animals, especially the social kind, possess a kind of affective memory, if not imagination proper. Why else does the dog bark and run in its sleep or effusively greet its long-gone owner?</div>

                There are things that intelligence alone is able to seek, but which, by itself, it will never find. These things instinct alone could find, but it will never seek them.

            <p class="source">Henri Bergson, <span class="work-title">&ldquo;Creative Evolution&rdquo;</span></p>
			<i><p>Strictly speaking, Bergson refers here to the notion (explained earlier in the essay) that whereas instinct consists partly in possessing some kind of innate knowledge of natural objects&mdash;of the essence of things&mdash;intelligence consists, alternatively, in formal knowlegde&mdash;that is, knowledge of relations among things. Instinct, in other words, deals with reality as such and intelligence with representation. The drawback of the former is that it can only be applied to the limited sphere of objects in the instinctual organism's sphere of awareness at any given time, and therefore cannot seek to know anything outside of its immediate reality. The drawback of the former&mdash;of intelligence&mdash;is that it can never quite access the essences of objects in the world, no matter how many such objects it can represent or permute or deconstruct and build anew.</p>
			<p>Perfectly knowledgeable beings would perhaps, one might think, possess instinct and intelligence in their highest order and in equal measure. But, on Bergon's view, this may not be possible, at least for life as we currently understand it. It may well be that, for better or worse, whatever of intelligence a species gains during the long march of evolution, it leaves behind in instinct&mdash;and vice versa.</p></i>

                <p>The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechamism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; reproduced and combined.</p>
				<p>There is, of course, a certain connection between those elements and relevant logical concepts. It is also clear that the desire to arrive finally at logically connected concepts is the emotional basis of this rather vague play with the above mentioned elements. But taken from a psychological viewpoint, this combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought&mdash;before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others.</p>
				. . . Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will.

                A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquility. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquility of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved; Caesar would have spared his own country; America would have been discovered more gradually; and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.
