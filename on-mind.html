                The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechamism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; reproduced and combined.
				<p>There is, of course, a certain connection between those elements and relevant logical concepts. It is also clear that the desire to arrive finally at logically connected concepts is the emotional basis of this rather vague play with the above mentioned elements. But taken from a psychological viewpoint, this combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought&mdash;before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others.</p>
				. . . Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will.

            <blockquote>
                A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquility. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquility of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved; Caesar would have spared his own country; America would have been discovered more gradually; and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.
