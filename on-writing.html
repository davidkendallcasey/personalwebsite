                We can take the beats of your outline . . . and if the words &ldquo;and then&rdquo; belong between those beats, you're fucked; you've got something pretty boring. What should happen between every beat that you've written down is either the word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; or &ldquo;but.&rdquo; . . . It should be <i>this</i> happens and therefore <i>this</i> happens, but <i>this</i> happens and therefore <i>this</i> happens . . . . &ldquo;But,&rdquo; &ldquo;because,&rdquo; &ldquo;therefore&rdquo;&emdash;that gives you the causation between each beat.

				​Many writers seem to me not to observe at all, but to create their characters in stock sizes from images in their own fancy. They are like draughtsmen who draw their figures from recollections of the antique and have never attempted to draw from the living model. At their best they can only give the living shape to the fantasies of their own minds. If their minds are noble they can give you noble figures and perhaps it does not matter if they lack the infinite complication of common life.

				<p>Selfishness and kindliness, idealism and sensuality, vanity, shyness, disinterestedness, courage, laziness, nervousness, obstinacy, and diffidence, they can all exist in a single person and form a plausible harmony. It has taken a long time to persuade readers of the truth of this.</p>

            <blockquote>
				​I do not know a better training for a writer than to spend some years in the medical profession. I suppose that you can learn a good deal about human nature in a solicitor’s office; but there on the whole you have to deal with men in full control of themselves. They lie perhaps as much as they lie to the doctor, but they lie more consistently, and it may be that for the solicitor it is not so necessary to know the truth. The interests he deal with, besides, are usually material. He sees human nature from a specialized standpoint. But the doctor, especially the hospital doctor, sees it bare. Reticences can generally be undermined; very often there are none. Fear for the most part will shatter every defence; even vanity is unnerved by it. Most people have a furious itch to talk about themselves and are restrained only by the disinclination of others to listen. Reserve is an artificial quality that is developed in most of us but as the result of innumerable rebuffs. The doctor is discreet. It is his business to listen and no details are too intimate for his ears.​
