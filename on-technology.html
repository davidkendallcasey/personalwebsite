			<blockquote>
			<p>That utility is one of the principal sources of beauty has been observed by every body, who has considered with any attention what constitutes the nature of beauty.</p>
			<p>The utility of any object ... pleases [its owner] by perpetually suggesting to him the pleasure or conveniency which it is fitted to promote. Every time he looks at it, he is put in mind of this pleasure; and the object in this manner becomes a source of perpetual satisfaction and enjoyment.</p>
			<p>...</p>
			<p>How many people ruin themselves by laying out money on trinkets of frivolous utility? What pleases these lovers of toys is not so much the utility, as the aptness of the machines which are fitted to promote it. All their pockets are stuffed with little conveniences. They contrive new pockets, unknown in the clothes of other people, in order to carry a greater number. They walk about loaded with a multitude of baubles ... of which the whole utility is certainly not worth the fatigue of bearing the burden.</p>
			<p>If we consider the real satisfaction which all these things are capable of affording, by itself and separated from the beauty of that arrangement which is fitten to promote it, it will always appear in the highest degree contemptible and trifling. But we rarely view it in this abstract and philosophical light. We naturally confound it in our imaginaton with the order, the regular and harmonious movement of the system, the machine or economy by means of which it is produced.</p>

		<div class="commentary-section">This is one of my favorite of Smith's ideas, and one of the most well-hidden gems in his broader project. The notion, if pervasive in his day, is even more so today. I tend to translate it thus: In a consumerist society, we see an advertisement for, say, an extremely sharp knife. This knife&mdash;we can see it demonstrated&mdash;is the single sharpest knife in the history of knives. It falls right through a ripe tomato when simply laid upon its skin. The knife is the best, the most efficient, at what it does&mdash;it has, in Smith's terms, a very high <i>utility</i>. But there is a trick that is played upon our minds in seeing this advertisement: we transpose the utility of the knife in itself (its ability to do the job it was designed for, better, perhaps, than all other objects of its kind) onto the utility it will add to our lives (that is, the &ldquo;happiness points,&rdquo; so to speak, that it will bring us). But this is a mistake. Yes, a knife may have be fantastic at cutting tomatoes, but the utility of the knife in this regard will accrue to our lives <i>only if</i> a significant portion of our lives are spent cutting tomatoes. For the rest of us, the utility of the knife is only a mirage&mdash;but a convincing one at that. How many of us have felt compelled to buy something due to sheer amazement at its ability to perform some task, only to realize that we do not need that task performed so often? The knife languishes in the bottom of the drawer, and we move on to the next thing&mdash;the smart watch, the storage container, the insulated thermos&mdash;that promises to finally satisfy our vague frustrations.</div>

			<blockquote>
			As regards human intelligence, it has not been sufficiently noted that mechanical invention has been from the first its essential feature, that even to-day our social life gravitates around the manufacture and use of artificial instruments, that the inventions which strew the road of progress have also traced its direction. This we hardly realise, because it takes us longer to change ourselves than to change our tools. Our individual and even social habits survive a good while the circumstances for which they were made, so that the ultimate effects of an invention are not observed until its novelty is already out of sight. ... In thousands of years, when, seen from the distance, only the broad lines of the present age will still be visible, our wars and our revolutions will count for little, even supposing they are remembered at all; but the steam-engine, and the procession of invention of every kind that accompanied it, will perhaps be spoken of as we speak of the bronze or of the chipped stone of prehistoric times: it will serve to define an age. If we could rid ourselves of all pride, if, to define our species, we kept strictly to what the historic and the prehistoric periods show us to be the constant characteristic of man and of intelligence, we should say not Homo sapiens, but Homo faber. In short, intelligence, considered in what seems to be its original feature, is the faculty of manufacturing artificial objects, especially tools to make tools, and of indefinitely varying the manufacture.

			<blockquote>
			<p>​Actual novelty only exists at the very crest of the wave, in the time, however short, between introduction and acceptance. Since the novelty in question is purely subjective in nature, dependent on its relative unfamiliarity to a new audience, it tends to evaporate almost at the very instant it is recognized.</p>
            <p>Innovation is therefore a term than compacts within itself the whole hopeless treadmill of capitalist advance that had been decried even before Marx, powered by a double bind in which novelty is both necessary and impossible at the same time. In such a system, oddly enough, the novel can persist only insofar as it meets with resistance and doesn’t diffuse. This is one reason why the avant-garde is often considered a necessary adjunct to the settled order it supposedly opposes.</p>
