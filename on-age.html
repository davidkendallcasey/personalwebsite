			<p><i>Inspired by the story of Hercules and Hylas (the former was left behind on the island of Mysia by his co-expeditioners, the Argonauts; he having been entranced by the wandering young man Hylas, who had been sent out for water but became lost among the flowers and subsequently captured by nymphs), a retrospective Moore laments spending his youth on frivolity:</i></p>
            <blockquote>
                When Hylas was sent with his urn to the fount,<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through fields full of light and with heart full of play,<br>
				Light rambled the boy over meadow and mount,<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And neglected his task for the flowers in the way.<br>
				<p>Thus many like me, who in youth should have tasted<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fountain that runs by Philosophy's shrine,<br>
				Their time with the flowers on the margin have wasted,<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left their light urns all as empty as mine.</p>
				But pledge me the goblet;&mdash;while idleness weaves<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These flowerets together, should Wisdom but see<br>
				One bright drop or two that has fall'n on the leaves<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her fountain divine, &lsquo;tis sufficient for me.<br>

                Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

                [William Stoner] had come to that moment in his age when there occurred to him, with increasing intensity, a question of such overwhelming simplicity that he had no means to face it. He found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been. It was a question, he suspected, that came to all men at one time or another; he wondered if it came to them with such impersonal force as it came to him. The question brought with it a sadness, but it was a general sadness which (he thought) had little to do with himself or with his particular fate; he was not even sure that the question sprang from the most immediate and obvious causes, from what his own life had become. It came, he believed, from the accretion of his years, from the density of accident and circumstance, and from what he had come to understand of them. He took a grim and ironic pleasure from the possibility that what little learning he had managed to acquire had led him to this knowledge: that in the long run all things, even the learning that let him know this, were futile and empty, and at last diminished into a nothingness they did not alter.

            <blockquote>
                As all the external sources of happiness and pleasure are, by their nature, highly uncertain, doubtful, ephemeral, and subject to chance, they dry up in certain circumstances; moreover, this is inevitable, as they cannot always be at hand. In old age, they almost all inevitable decline; for it is then that we are abandoned by love, banter, the pleasures of travelling and horse riding, as well as the aptitude to play a part in the world, and even by our friends and relatives who are taken from us by death. It is then, more than ever, that there returns the question of knowing what every man has for himself, because that is what will last the longest.

                A man very often goes on living after he has completely lost the capacity of taking from life that wherein we are wont to see its essence and meaning. More striking still, a broken man is generally deprived of everything except the ability to acknowledge and feel his position. Nay, for the most part in such cases the intellectual abilities are refined and sharpened and increased to colossal proportions. It frequently happens that an average man, banal and mediocre, is changed beyond all recognition when he falls into the exceptional situation of [being close to death]. In him appear signs of a gift, a talent, even of genius. Nietzsche once asked: 'Can an ass be tragical?' He left his question unanswered, but Tolstoi answered for him in The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Ivan Ilyich . . . is a mediocre, average character, one of those men who pass through life avoiding anything that is difficult or problematical, caring exclusively for the calm and pleasantness of earthly existence. Hardly had the cold wind of tragedy blown upon him, than he was utterly transformed. The story of Ivan Ilyich in his last days is as deeply interesting as the life-story of Socrates or Pascal.

                While extreme stress can quickly kill a plant, small amounts of stress can trigger survival responses as the plant adapts to its environment. For example, outdoor plants that are exposed to lower water conditions can become hardier in the long run. In other words, the stress triggers the plant's survival instinct. For a rootbound plant, the response is a little different, though the motivation is the same. As the roots become more tightly contained within the planter, the Bird of Paradise will believe that it has reached the end of its growth potential and will respond accordingly. Why does that lead to flowering? Because, while we enjoy flowers for their beauty, blooms are actually how a plant propagates its species. Plants don't produce flowers under every kind of stress, in part because some forms of stress would make it difficult to produce blooms—such as dehydration or lack of light. But since an otherwise healthy Bird of Paradise doesn't know if it will survive the threat of crowding its roots, it rushes to bloom before it dies.

                Despite Freud's conviction that stored contents remain unaltered by time, I have come to believe that something does happen to them. Warmth finds its way into the cold storage vaults. In older age, the images become more pleasant. Arduous struggles, envious rivalries, even betrayals come back with a new valence. They don't hurt as much. The musing may even make them amusing. The long illness, the wrong marriage, all the slings and arrows of outrage lose their fire and forget their aim. Why do the dark days of the past lighten up in late recollection? Is it a subtle hint that the soul is letting go of the weights it has been carrying, preparing to lift off more easily? Is this a premonition of what religious traditions call heaven, this euphoric tone now coating many of the worst experiences, so that there is little left to forgive? At the end the unforgiveness will never be forgotten, because in old age they do not need to be forgiven: they have simply been forgotten. Forgetting, that marvel of the old mind, may actually be the truest form of forgiveness, and a blessing.
