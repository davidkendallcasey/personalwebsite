			<blockquote>
			What is a poet? An unhappy man who conceals profound anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so fashioned that when sighs and groans pass over them they sound like beautiful music. People flock about the poet and say to him: do sing again; Which means, would that new sufferings tormented your soul, and: would that your lips stayed fashioned as before, for your cries would only terrify us, but your music is delightful. And the critics join them, saying: well done, thus must it be according to the laws of aesthetics. Why, to be sure, a critic resembles a poet as one pea another, the only difference being that he has no anguish in his heart and no music on his lips. Behold, therefore would I rather be a swineherd on Amager, and be understood by the swine than a poet, and misunderstood by men.

			<blockquote>
			The painter passes through states of fullness and of emptying. That is the whole secret of art. I take a walk in the forest of Fontainebleau. There I get an indigestion of greenness, I must empty this sensation into a picture. Green dominates in it. The painter paints as if in urgent need to discharge himself of his sensations and his visions. Men take possession of it as a means of covering their nakedness a little. They take what they can and as they can. I believe that finally they take nothing, they quite simply cut out a coat to the measure of their own incomprehension. They make in their own image everything from God to the picture. That is why the nail is the undoer of painting. Painting has always some importance, at least that of the man who made it. The day it is bought and hung on the wall it takes on an importance of another kind, and the painting is done for.

			<blockquote>
			When one begins a picture one often discusses fine things. One ought to beware of these, destroy one's picture, recreate it many times. On each destruction of a beautiful find, the artist does not suppress it, to tell the truth; rather he transforms it, condenses it, makes it more substantial. The issue is the result of rejected discoveries. Otherwise one becomes one's own admirer. I sell myself nothing!

			<p>​Whenever I so very fervently enjoy how a beautiful strain of sounds suddenly, in free spontaneity, extricates itself from the empty stillness and rises up like sacrificial incense, floats gently on the bresses, and then silently sinks down to earth again;&mdash;then so many new, beautiful images sprout forth and flock together in my heart that I cannot control myself out of rapture. &mdash; Sometimes music appears to me like a phoenix, which lighly and boldly raises itself for its own pleasure, floats upwards triumphantly for its own gratification, and pleases gods and men by the flapping of its wings. &mdash; At other times it seems to me as if music were like a child lying dead in the grave;&mdash;one reddish sunbeam from heaven gently draws its soul away and, transplanted into the heavenly aether, it enjoys golden drops of eternity and embraces the original images of the most beautiful human dreams. &mdash; And sometimes, &mdash; what a magnificent fullness of images! &mdash; sometimes music is for me entirely a picture of our life:&mdash;a touchingly brief joy, which arises out of the void and vanishes into the void,&mdash;which commences and passes away, why one does not know:&mdash;a little, merry, green island, with sunshine, with singing and rejoicing,&mdash;which floats upon the dark, unfathomable ocean.</p>

			[Music] is the only art which reduces the most multifarious and contradictory emotions of our souls to the <i>same</i> beautiful harmonies, which plays with joy and sorrow, with despair and adoration in the same harmonious tones. Therefore, it is also music which infuses in us true <i>serenity of soul</i>, which is the most beautiful jewel that the human being can acquire;&mdash;I mean that serenity in which everything in the world seems to us natural, true, and good, in which we find a beautiful cohesion in the wildest throng of people, in which, with sincere hearts, we feel all creatures to be related and close to us and, like children, look upon the world as through the twilight of a lovely dream.

                Art is not difficult because it wishes to be difficult, but because it wishes to be art. However much the writer might long to be, in his work, simple, honest, and straightforward, these virtues are no longer available to him. He discovers that in being simple, honest, and straightforward, nothing much happens: he speaks the speakable, whereas what we are looking for is the as-yet unspeakable, the as-yet unspoken.

                <p>Let us suppose that I am the toughest banjulele player in town and I have been contracted to play &ldquo;Melancholy Baby&rdquo; for six hours before an audience that will include the four next-toughest banjulele players in town. We imagine the smoky basement club, the hustling waiters (themselves students of the jazz banjulele) . . . forming a congenial group at the bar. There is one thing of which you may be sure: I am not going to play &ldquo;Melancholy Baby&rdquo; as written. Rather I will play something that is parallel, in some sense, to &ldquo;Melancholy Baby,&rdquo; having to do with &ldquo;Melancholy Baby,&rdquo; made out of &ldquo;Melancholy Baby&rdquo;&mdash;commentary, exegesis, elaboration, contradiction. The interest of my construction, if any, is located in the space between the new entity I have constructed and the &ldquo;real&rdquo; &ldquo;Melancholy Baby,&rdquo; which remains in the mind as the horizon which bounds my efforts.</p>
                <p>This is, I think, the relation of art to the world. I suggest that art is always a meditation upon external reality rather than a representation of external reality or a jackleg attempt to &ldquo;be&rdquo; external reality.</p>

Beckett speaks of &ldquo;the long sonata of the dead&rdquo;&mdash;where on earth did the word sonata come from, imposing as it does an orderly, even exalted design upon the most disorderly, distressing phenomenon known to us? The fact is not challenged, but understood, momentarily, in a new way. It's our good fortune to be able to imagine alternative realities, other possibilities. We can quarrel with the world, constructively...</p>

			​The picture is not thought out and determined beforehand, rather while it is being made it follows the mobility of thought. Finished, it changes further, according to the condition of him who looks at it. A picture lives its life like a living creature, undergoing the changes that daily life imposes on us. That is natural, since a picture lives only through him who looks at it.

			<p>​When I once get <i>the feeling of my subject</i>, and get to know it, I usually draw it in three or more variations&mdash;be it a figure or landscape&mdash; only I always refer to Nature for every one of them and then I do my best not to put in <i>any detail</i>, as the dream quality would then be lost.

		<p><i>This quotation, like Barthelme's and Picasso's above, gives truth to the notion that art necessarily involves a creative act on the part of the viewer or reader or listener. To Barthelme's and Picasso's points, we must always impose on artistic representations our reality as we experience it. And therefore art needn't explicitly be</i> about <i>anything. It only needs to build a minimally intelligible structure on which we can drape the contents of our consciousness.</i></p>

                <p>The grotesque is a structure. Its nature could be summed up in a phrase ... : <i>the grotesque is the estranged world</i>. But some additional explanation is required. For viewed from the outside, the world of the fairy tale could also be regarded as strange and alien. Yet its world is not estranged, that is to say, the elements in it which are familiar and natural to us do not suddenly turn out to be strange and ominous. It is our world which has to be transformed. Suddenness and surprise are essential elements of the grotesque. In literature the grotesque appears in a scene or an animated tableau. Its representations in the plastic arts, too, do not refer to a state of repose but to an action, a &ldquo;pregnant moment,&rdquo; or at least&mdash;in the case of Kafka&mdash;a situation that is filled with ominous tension. . . . We are so strongly affected and terrified because it is our world which ceases to be reliable, and we feel that we would be unable to live in this changed world. The grotesque instills fear of life rather than fear of death. Structurally, it presupposes that the categories which apply to our world view become inapplicable. . . . [It is] the fusion of realms which we know to be separated, the abolition of the law of statics, the loss of identity, the distortion of &ldquo;natural&rdquo; size and shape, the suspension of the category of objects, the destruction of personality, and the fragmentation of the historical order.</p>
				<p>But who effects the estrangement of the world, who announces his presence in this overwhelming ominousness? Only now do we plumb the final depth of the horror that is inspired by the transformed world. These questions remain unanswered. Apocalyptic beasts emerge from the abyss; demons intrude upon us. If we were able to name those powers and relate them to the cosmic order, the grotesque would lose its essential quality. . . . One could use another descriptive phrase and characterize the grotesque as the objectification of the &ldquo;It,&rdquo; the ghostly &ldquo;It&rdquo;&mdash;in contrast to the psychological &ldquo;It&rdquo; (it pleases me = I am glad) and the cosmic &ldquo;It&rdquo; (it rains)&mdash;the &ldquo;It&rdquo; which Ammann defined as the third meaning of the impersonal pronoun.</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<p><i>The grotesque is a play with the absurd.</i> It may begin in a gay and carefree manner. ... But it may also carry the player away, deprive him of his freedom, and make him afraid of the ghosts which he so frivolously invoked. And now no helper comes to his rescue. The creators of grotesques have no advice that they can follow. ...</p>
				<p>In many grotesques, little is to be felt of ... freedom and gaiety. But where the artistic creation has succeeded, a faint smile seems to pass rapidly across the scene or picture, and slight traces of the playful frivolity of the capriccio appear to be present. And there, but only there, another kind of feeling arises within us. In spite of all the helplessness and horror inspired by the dark forces which lurk in and behind our world and have power to estrange it, the truly artistic portrayal effects a secret liberation. The darkness has been sighted, the ominous places discovered, the incomprehensible forces challenged. And thus we arrive at a final interpretation of the grotesque: <i>an attempt to invoke and subdue the demonic aspects of the world</i>.</p>

			It is the subject of <i>willing</i>, that is to say, his own will, which fills the consciousness of the lyrical author, often as a free and satisfied willing (joy), but much more often as a frustrated willing (sadness), and always as an emotion, a passion, a state of mind. Yet, alongside and at the same time as this state, the glances that the poet casts on the nature all around him make him aware of himself as a pure subject of knowledge, independent of willing, whose imperturbable spiritual peace contrasts with the desires of the ever-pressured, ever-greedy will: the feeling of this contrast, of this alternation, is expressed in the genre of lyric poems, and constitutes in short the lyrical state of mind. In this state, <i>pure knowledge</i> comes to us to deliver us from willing and its torments: we surrender ourselves to it, but only for a moment; ever and again the will, and the memory of our personal goals, comes to tear us away from peaceful contemplation; but again and again the beauty of our surroundings, through which a knowledge liberated from willing is offered to us, comes to seduce us. That is why, in song and lyrical inspiration, the will (self-interested and personal views) and the pure intuition of our surroundings are admirably mixed: reconciliations between the two are sought out and imagined; the subjective disposition of mind, the affection of willing, plays a part in the intuition of the surrounding world, and reciprocally lends its colours to it: the true lyric poem is the imprint of these mixed and shared states of mind.

Restating old truths and adapting them to the age, applying them in ways they were never before applied, stirring up emotion by the inherent power of narrative, visual image, or music, artists crack the door to the morally necessary future.

			<p>In his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better judge?) art, in this case, as well as in many others, if well managed, will assist and improve nature. But this is not all; for sometimes we find the force of it so great and powerful, that, where it is wholly counterfeit, it will for the time work the same effect as if it were founded in truth. This is well known to those who have been conversant with the representations of the theatre. In tragedies, though we are sensible that everything we see and hear is counterfeit; yet such is the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by it in the same manner as if it were all reality.</p>
