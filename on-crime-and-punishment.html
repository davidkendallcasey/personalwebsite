            <blockquote>
                There is something nightmarish about the scaffold when it is standing there ready. It is possible to feel a certain indifference about the death penalty, not to declare yourself, to say yes and no, so long as you have not seen a guillotine with your own eyes. But if you do come across one, it has a violent impact. You are forced to make a decision, to take sides, for or against. . . . The guillotine is the law made concrete. Its name is retribution. It is not neutral and does not allow you to remain neutral. Whoever sees it shudders with the most mysterious of shudders. All social problems raise question marks around this blade. The scaffold is not a structure. The scaffold is not a machine. The scaffold is not an inert contraption made of wood, iron and rope. It is as though it were some kind of being with its own sinister initiative. To all appearances this wooden construction can see, this machine can hear, this contraption can understand, this wood, this iron and this rope have a will of their own. Its presence casts the soul into a ghastly trance in which the scaffold appears terrifying and involved in what it is doing. The scaffold is the executioner's accomplice. It devours. It eats flesh. It drinks blood. The scaffold is a kind of monster put together by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre that seems to live by some dreadful life force created out of all the death it has inflicted.

                Teach those who are ignorant as much as you can. Society is to blame for not giving free education. It’s responsible for the darkness it produces. In any benighted soul—that’s where sin will be committed. It’s not he who commits the sin that’s to blame but he who causes the darkness to prevail.

                My fault is past, but, O, what form of prayer<br>
				Can serve my turn? &ldquo;Forgive me my foul murder?&rdquo;<br>
				That cannot be, since I am still possessed<br>
				Of those effects for which I did the murder,<br>
				My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen,<br>
				May one be pardoned and retain th’ offense?<br>
				. . .<br>
				Try what repentance can. What can it not?<br>
				Yet what can it when one cannot repent?<br>
				O wretched state! O bosom black as death!<br>
				O limèd soul, that struggling to be free<br>
				Art more engaged!
