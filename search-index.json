In old age, they almost all inevitable decline; for it is then that we are abandoned by love, banter, the pleasures of travelling and horse riding, as well as the aptitude to play a part in the world, and even by our friends and relatives who are taken from us by death. It is then, more than ever, that there returns the question of knowing what every man has for himself, because that is what will last the longest. Arthur Schopenhauer A man very often goes on living after he has completely lost the capacity of taking from life that wherein we are wont to see its essence and meaning. More striking still, a broken man is generally deprived of everything except the ability to acknowledge and feel his position. Nay, for the most part in such cases the intellectual abilities are refined and sharpened and increased to colossal proportions. It frequently happens that an average man, banal and mediocre, is changed beyond all recognition when he falls into the exceptional situation of [being close to death]. In him appear signs of a gift, a talent, even of genius. Nietzsche once asked: 'Can an ass be tragical?' He left his question unanswered, but Tolstoi answered for him in The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Ivan Ilyich . . . is a mediocre, average character, one of those men who pass through life avoiding anything that is difficult or problematical, caring exclusively for the calm and pleasantness of earthly existence. Hardly had the cold wind of tragedy blown upon him, than he was utterly transformed. The story of Ivan Ilyich in his last days is as deeply interesting as the life-story of Socrates or Pascal. Lev Shestov, Anton Tchekhov, and Other Essays While extreme stress can quickly kill a plant, small amounts of stress can trigger survival responses as the plant adapts to its environment. For example, outdoor plants that are exposed to lower water conditions can become hardier in the long run. In other words, the stress triggers the plant's survival instinct. For a rootbound plant, the response is a little different, though the motivation is the same. As the roots become more tightly contained within the planter, the Bird of Paradise will believe that it has reached the end of its growth potential and will respond accordingly. Why does that lead to flowering? Because, while we enjoy flowers for their beauty, blooms are actually how a plant propagates its species. Plants don't produce flowers under every kind of stress, in part because some forms of stress would make it difficult to produce blooms—such as dehydration or lack of light. But since an otherwise healthy Bird of Paradise doesn't know if it will survive the threat of crowding its roots, it rushes to bloom before it dies. Tracy Kelly, The Healthy Houseplant There is the same custom in literature as in Terra del Fuego. The young, growing men kill and eat the old. . . . The rising star shines always brighter than the setting, and the old must of their own will yield themselves up to be devoured by the young. Lev Shestov, Anton Tchekhov, and Other Essays As the Aegean, when those winds have died Which only lately made it churn and leap, Does not at once grow calm, or put aside The roar and violence of the raging deep. Tasso (per Montaigne) Despite Freud's conviction that stored contents remain unaltered by time, I have come to believe that something does happen to them. Warmth finds its way into the cold storage vaults. In older age, the images become more pleasant. Arduous struggles, envious rivalries, even betrayals come back with a new valence. They don't hurt as much. The musing may even make them amusing. The long illness, the wrong marriage, all the slings and arrows of outrage lose their fire and forget their aim. Why do the dark days of the past lighten up in late recollection? Is it a subtle hint that the soul is letting go of the weights it has been carrying, preparing to lift off more easily? Is this a premonition of what religious traditions call heaven, this euphoric tone now coating many of the worst experiences, so that there is little left to forgive? At the end the unforgiveness will never be forgotten, because in old age they do not need to be forgiven: they have simply been forgotten. Forgetting, that marvel of the old mind, may actually be the truest form of forgiveness, and a blessing. James Hillman, The Force of Character and the Lasting Life By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Shakespeare, Hamlet Hamlet: [Speaking of Polonius] That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts. Rosencrantz: Happily [perhaps] he is the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child. Shakespeare, Hamlet [A] tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only tool that grows keener by constant use.

    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Art ​Whenever I so very fervently enjoy how a beautiful strain of sounds suddenly, in free spontaneity, extricates itself from the empty stillness and rises up like sacrificial incense, floats gently on the bresses, and then silently sinks down to earth again;&mdash;then so many new, beautiful images sprout forth and flock together in my heart that I cannot control myself out of rapture. &mdash; Sometimes music appears to me like a phoenix, which lighly and boldly raises itself for its own pleasure, floats upwards triumphantly for its own gratification, and pleases gods and men by the flapping of its wings. &mdash; At other times it seems to me as if music were like a child lying dead in the grave;&mdash;one reddish sunbeam from heaven gently draws its soul away and, transplanted into the heavenly aether, it enjoys golden drops of eternity and embraces the original images of the most beautiful human dreams. &mdash; And sometimes, &mdash; what a magnificent fullness of images! &mdash; sometimes music is for me entirely a picture of our life:&mdash;a touchingly brief joy, which arises out of the void and vanishes into the void,&mdash;which commences and passes away, why one does not know:&mdash;a little, merry, green island, with sunshine, with singing and rejoicing,&mdash;which floats upon the dark, unfathomable ocean. Ask the virtuoso why he is so heartily gay upon his lyre. “Is not,” he will answer, “all of life a beautiful dream? a lovely soap-bubble? My musical piece is the same.” W.H. Wackenroder, Confessions and Fantasies (trans. M.H. Schubert) [Music] is the only art which reduces the most multifarious and contradictory emotions of our souls to the same beautiful harmonies, which plays with joy and sorrow, with despair and adoration in the same harmonious tones. Therefore, it is also music which infuses in us true serenity of soul, which is the most beautiful jewel that the human being can acquire;&mdash;I mean that serenity in which everything in the world seems to us natural, true, and good, in which we find a beautiful cohesion in the wildest throng of people, in which, with sincere hearts, we feel all creatures to be related and close to us and, like children, look upon the world as through the twilight of a lovely dream. W.H. Wackenroder, Confessions and Fantasies (trans. M.H. Schubert) Art is not difficult because it wishes to be difficult, but because it wishes to be art. However much the writer might long to be, in his work, simple, honest, and straightforward, these virtues are no longer available to him. He discovers that in being simple, honest, and straightforward, nothing much happens: he speaks the speakable, whereas what we are looking for is the as-yet unspeakable, the as-yet unspoken. Donald Barthelme, Not Knowing Let us suppose that I am the toughest banjulele player in town and I have been contracted to play “Melancholy Baby” for six hours before an audience that will include the four next-toughest banjulele players in town. We imagine the smoky basement club, the hustling waiters (themselves students of the jazz banjulele) . . . forming a congenial group at the bar. There is one thing of which you may be sure: I am not going to play “Melancholy Baby” as written. Rather I will play something that is parallel, in some sense, to “Melancholy Baby,” having to do with “Melancholy Baby,” made out of “Melancholy Baby”—commentary, exegesis, elaboration, contradiction. The interest of my construction, if any, is located in the space between the new entity I have constructed and the “real” “Melancholy Baby,” which remains in the mind as the horizon which bounds my efforts. This is, I think, the relation of art to the world. I suggest that art is always a meditation upon external reality rather than a representation of external reality or a jackleg attempt to “be” external reality. ... Style enables us to speak, to imagine again. Beckett speaks of “the long sonata of the dead”—where on earth did the word sonata come from, imposing as it does an orderly, even exalted design upon the most disorderly, distressing phenomenon known to us? The fact is not challenged, but understood, momentarily, in a new way. It's our good fortune to be able to imagine alternative realities, other possibilities. We can quarrel with the world, constructively... Donald Barthelme, Not Knowing 1 ​ They take them out in the morning to the stone courtyard and put them against the wall five men two of them very young the other middle-aged nothing more can be said about them 2 when the platoon level their guns everything suddenly appears in the garish light of obviousness the yellow wall the cold blue the black wire on the wall instead of a horizon that is the moment when the five senses rebel they would gladly escape like rats from a sinking ship before the bullet reaches its destination the eye will perceive the flight of the projectile the ear record the steely rustle the nostrils will be filled with biting smoke a petal of blood will brush the palate the touch will shrink and then slacken now they lie on the ground covered up to their eyes with shadow the platoon walks away their button strap and steel helmets are more alive than those lying beside the wall 3 I did not learn this today I knew this before yesterday so why have I been writing unimportant poems on flowers what did the five talk of the night before the execution of prophetic dreams of an escapade in a brothel of automobile parts of a sea voyage of how when he had spades he ought to have opened of how vodka is best after wine you get a headache of girls of fruit of life thus one can use in poetry names of Greek shepherds one can attempt to catch the color of morning sky write of love and also once again in dead earnest offer to the betrayed world a rose Zbigniew Herbert, \"Five Men\" (trans. Czesław Miłoz & P.D. Scott) Go, lovely rose! Tell her that wastes her time and me That now she knows, When I resemble her to thee, How sweet and fair she seems to be. Tell her that's young, And shuns to have her graces spied, That hadst thou sprung In deserts, where no men abide, Thou must have uncommended died. Small is the worth Of beauty from the light retired; Bid her come forth, Suffer herself to be desired, And not blush so to be admired. Then die! that she The common fate of all things rare May read in thee; How small a part of time they share That are so wondrous sweet and fair! Edmund Waller (1606-1687), “Go, lovely rose!” Nothing is ordinary when submitted to a silent and sustained scrutiny. ​Julio Cortázar, The grotesque is a structure. Its nature could be summed up in a phrase ... : the grotesque is the estranged world. But some additional explanation is required. For viewed from the outside, the world of the fairy tale could also be regarded as strange and alien. Yet its world is not estranged, that is to say, the elements in it which are familiar and natural to us do not suddenly turn out to be strange and ominous. It is our world which has to be transformed. Suddenness and surprise are essential elements of the grotesque. In literature the grotesque appears in a scene or an animated tableau. Its representations in the plastic arts, too, do not refer to a state of repose but to an action, a “pregnant moment,” or at least—in the case of Kafka—a situation that is filled with ominous tension. . . . We are so strongly affected and terrified because it is our world which ceases to be reliable, and we feel that we would be unable to live in this changed world. The grotesque instills fear of life rather than fear of death. Structurally, it presupposes that the categories which apply to our world view become inapplicable. . . . [It is] the fusion of realms which we know to be separated, the abolition of the law of statics, the loss of identity, the distortion of “natural” size and shape, the suspension of the category of objects, the destruction of personality, and the fragmentation of the historical order. But who effects the estrangement of the world, who announces his presence in this overwhelming ominousness? Only now do we plumb the final depth of the horror that is inspired by the transformed world. These questions remain unanswered. Apocalyptic beasts emerge from the abyss; demons intrude upon us. If we were able to name those powers and relate them to the cosmic order, the grotesque would lose its essential quality. . . . One could use another descriptive phrase and characterize the grotesque as the objectification of the “It,” the ghostly “It”—in contrast to the psychological “It” (it pleases me = I am glad) and the cosmic “It” (it rains)—the “It” which Ammann defined as the third meaning of the impersonal pronoun. ... The grotesque is a play with the absurd. It may begin in a gay and carefree manner. ... But it may also carry the player away, deprive him of his freedom, and make him afraid of the ghosts which he so frivolously invoked. And now no helper comes to his rescue. The creators of grotesques have no advice that they can follow. ... In many grotesques, little is to be felt of ... freedom and gaiety. But where the artistic creation has succeeded, a faint smile seems to pass rapidly across the scene or picture, and slight traces of the playful frivolity of the capriccio appear to be present. And there, but only there, another kind of feeling arises within us. In spite of all the helplessness and horror inspired by the dark forces which lurk in and behind our world and have power to estrange it, the truly artistic portrayal effects a secret liberation. The darkness has been sighted, the ominous places discovered, the incomprehensible forces challenged. And thus we arrive at a final interpretation of the grotesque: an attempt to invoke and subdue the demonic aspects of the world. ​Wolfgang Kayser, The Grotesque in Art and Literature [Watching the movie Blue Velvet by David Lynch] was my first hint that being a surrealist, or being a “weird” writer, didn't exempt you from certain responsibilities, but in fact it obligated and upped them—that whatever the project of surrealism is works way better if 99.9 percent of it is absolutely real. I mean, most of the word “surrealism” is “realism”; it's extra-realism, something on top of realism. It's that one thing in a Lynch frame that's off—that if everything else weren't picture perfect and totally structured, wouldn't hit. ​David Foster Wallace, interview It is the subject of willing, that is to say, his own will, which fills the consciousness of the lyrical author, often as a free and satisfied willing (joy), but much more often as a frustrated willing (sadness), and always as an emotion, a passion, a state of mind. Yet, alongside and at the same time as this state, the glances that the poet casts on the nature all around him make him aware of himself as a pure subject of knowledge, independent of willing, whose imperturbable spiritual peace contrasts with the desires of the ever-pressured, ever-greedy will: the feeling of this contrast, of this alternation, is expressed in the genre of lyric poems, and constitutes in short the lyrical state of mind. In this state, pure knowledge comes to us to deliver us from willing and its torments: we surrender ourselves to it, but only for a moment; ever and again the will, and the memory of our personal goals, comes to tear us away from peaceful contemplation; but again and again the beauty of our surroundings, through which a knowledge liberated from willing is offered to us, comes to seduce us. That is why, in song and lyrical inspiration, the will (self-interested and personal views) and the pure intuition of our surroundings are admirably mixed: reconciliations between the two are sought out and imagined; the subjective disposition of mind, the affection of willing, plays a part in the intuition of the surrounding world, and reciprocally lends its colours to it: the true lyric poem is the imprint of these mixed and shared states of mind. Arthur Schopenhauer It is one of our problems that as we become crowded together, the sounds we make to each other, in our increasingly complex communication systems, become more random-sounding, accidental or incidental, and we have trouble selecting meaningful signals out of the noise. One reason is, of course, that we do not seem able to restrict our communication to information-bearing, relevant signals. Given any new technology for transmitting information, we seem bound to use it for great quantities of small talk. We are only saved by music from being overwhelmed by nonsense. Lewis Thomas, “The Music of This Sphere” It is sometimes remarked, not by enemies of fiction but by people who love it, that whereas scientists and politicians work for progress, the writer of fiction restates what has always been known, finding new expressions for familiar truths, adapting to the age truths that may seem outmoded. ... But the fact remains that art produces the most important progress civilization knows. Restating old truths and adapting them to the age, applying them in ways they were never before applied, stirring up emotion by the inherent power of narrative, visual image, or music, artists crack the door to the morally necessary future. John Gardner, The Art of Fiction [I]t is evident that a painted image—intangible by its very nature—hides nothing, while the tangibly visible object hides another visible thing—if we trust our experience. For a time a curious priority has been accorded “the invisible,” owing to a confused literature, whose interest vanishes if we remember that the visible can be hidden, but the invisible hides nothing; it can be known or not known, no more. There is no reason to accord more importance to the invisible than to the visible, nor vice versa. René Magritte, letter to Michel Foucault (1966) The death of interpretation is to believe that there are signs, signs that exist primally, originally, really, as coherent, pertinent, and systematic marks. ... The life of interpretation, on the contrary, is to believe that there are only interpretations. Michel Foucault, This is Not a Pipe We’re always rationally explaining and articulating things, but we’re at our most intelligent in the moment just before we start to explain or articulate. Great art occurs, or doesn’t, in that instant. What we turn to art for is precisely this moment when we know something, we feel it, but can’t articulate it because it’s too complex and multiple. But the knowing, in such moments, though happening without language, is real. I’d say this is what art is for. To remind us that this other sort of knowing is not only real, it’s superior to our usual, conceptual, reductive way. George Saunders, A Swim in a Pond in the Rain A work of art moves us by being honest and that honesty is apparent in its language and its form and in its resistance to concealment. George Saunders, A Swim in the Pond in the Rain ​Cicero says, “It is certain that truth (by which he means nature) in everything, excels imitation; but if that were sufficient of itself in action, we should have no occasion for art.” In his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better judge?) art, in this case, as well as in many others, if well managed, will assist and improve nature. But this is not all; for sometimes we find the force of it so great and powerful, that, where it is wholly counterfeit, it will for the time work the same effect as if it were founded in truth. This is well known to those who have been conversant with the representations of the theatre. In tragedies, though we are sensible that everything we see and hear is counterfeit; yet such is the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by it in the same manner as if it were all reality. Anger and resentment, at the appearance of cruelty, concern and solicitude for distressed virtue, rise in our breasts; and tears are extorted from us for oppressed innocence: though at the same time, perhaps, we are ready to laugh at ourselves for being thus decoyed.

    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Benevolence ​Whatever folly men commit, be their shortcomings or their vices what they may, let us exercise forbearance; remembering that when these faults appear in others, it is our follies and vices that we behold. They are the shortcomings of humanity, to which we belong; whose faults, one and all, we share; yes, even those very faults at which we now wax so indignant, merely because they have not yet appeared in ourselves. They are faults that do not lie on the surface. But they exist down there in the depths of our nature; and should anything call them forth, they will come and show themselves, just as we now see them in others. One man, it is true, may have faults that are absent in his fellow; and it is undeniable that the sum total of bad qualities is in some cases very large; for the difference of individuality between man and man passes all measure. In fact, the conviction that the world and man is something that had better not have been, is of a kind to fill us with indulgence towards one another. Nay, from this point of view, we might consider the proper form of address to be, not Monsieur, Sir, mein Herr, but my fellow-sufferer, Soci malorum, compagnon de miseres! This may perhaps sound strange, but it is in keeping with the facts; it puts others in a right light; and it reminds us of that which is after all the most necessary thing in life—the tolerance, patience, regard, and love of neighbor, of which everyone stands in need, and which, therefore, every man owes to his fellow. Arthur Schopenhauer, “On the Sufferings of the World” The worship of force, to which Carlyle and Nietzsche and the creed of militarism have accustomed us, is the result of failure to maintain our own ideals against a hostile universe; it is itself a prostrate submission to evil, a sacrifice of our best to Moloch. If strength indeed is to be respected, let us respect rather the strength of those who refuse that false ``recognition of facts\" which fails to recognize that facts are often bad. Let us admit that, in the world we know, there are many things that would be better otherwise, and that the ideals to which we do and must adhere are not realized in the realm of matter. Let us preserve our respect for truth, for beauty, for the ideal of perfection which life does not permit us to attain, though none of these things meets with the approval of the unconscious universe. If power is bad, as it seems to be, let us reject it from our hearts. In this lies man's true freedom: in determination to worship only the God created by our own love of the good, to respect only the heaven which inspires the insight of our best moments. In action, in desire, we must submit perpetually to the tyranny of outside forces; but in thought, in aspiration, we are free, free from our fellow men, free from the petty planet on which our bodies impotently crawl, free even, while we live, from the tyranny of death. Let us learn, then, that energy of faith which enables us to live constantly in the vision of the good; and let us descend, in action, into the world of fact, with that vision always before us. Bertrand Russell, “A Free Man's Worship” ​In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world. We have only our story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is. John Steinbeck, East of Eden ​You often say, ``I would give, but only to the deserving.\" The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture. They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish. Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and nights, is worthy of all else from you. And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream. And what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving? And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed? See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving. Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet [F]or the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.

It is possible to feel a certain indifference about the death penalty, not to declare yourself, to say yes and no, so long as you have not seen a guillotine with your own eyes. But if you do come across one, it has a violent impact. You are forced to make a decision, to take sides, for or against. . . . The guillotine is the law made concrete. Its name is retribution. It is not neutral and does not allow you to remain neutral. Whoever sees it shudders with the most mysterious of shudders. All social problems raise question marks around this blade. The scaffold is not a structure. The scaffold is not a machine. The scaffold is not an inert contraption made of wood, iron and rope. It is as though it were some kind of being with its own sinister initiative. To all appearances this wooden construction can see, this machine can hear, this contraption can understand, this wood, this iron and this rope have a will of their own. Its presence casts the soul into a ghastly trance in which the scaffold appears terrifying and involved in what it is doing. The scaffold is the executioner's accomplice. It devours. It eats flesh. It drinks blood. The scaffold is a kind of monster put together by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre that seems to live by some dreadful life force created out of all the death it has inflicted. Victor Hugo, Les Miserables (trans. Christine Donougher) Teach those who are ignorant as much as you can. Society is to blame for not giving free education. It’s responsible for the darkness it produces. In any benighted soul—that’s where sin will be committed. It’s not he who commits the sin that’s to blame but he who causes the darkness to prevail.

    "title": "On Culture - David Kendall Casey",
    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Culture In part, the contrast in the rate of change [between and among civilizations] is . . . that between Nature and Man as makers of change. Mankind increasingly chooses for itself, and even in prehistory the story of change is therefore increasingly one of conscious adaptation. . . . This is why the most important part of the human story is the story of consciousness; when, long ago, it broke the genetic slow march, it made everything else possible. Nature and nurture are there from the moment that human beings are first identifiable; perhaps they can never be quite disentangled, but man-made culture and tradition are increasingly the determinants of change. Two reflections ought, none the less, to be made to balance this indisputable fact. The first is that our species has almost certainly not shown any improvement in innate capacity since the Upper Palaeolithic. Human physique has not changed fundamentally in 40,000 years or so and it would be surprising if raw human mental capacity had done so. So short a time could hardly suffice for genetic changes comparable to those of earlier eras. The rapidity with which humanity has achieved so much since prehistoric times can be accounted for quite simply: there are many more of us upon whose talents humanity can draw and, more important still, human achievements are essentially cumulative. They rest upon a heritage itself accumulating at, as it were, compound interest. . . . If this is all speculative, the second reflection need not be: his genetic inheritance not only enables Homo sapiens to make conscious change, to undertake an unprecedented kind of evolution, but also controls and limits him. The irrationalities of the twentieth century show the narrow limits of our capacity for conscious control of our destiny. To this extent, we are still determined, still unfree, still a part of a nature which produced our unique qualities in the first place only by evolutionary selection. It is not easy to separate this part of our inheritance, either, from the emotional shaping the human psyche has received from the processes through which it is evolved. That shaping still lies deep at the heart of all our aesthetic and affective life. Man must live with an in-built dualism​. To deal with it has been the aim of most of the great philosophies and religions and the mythologies by which we still live, but they are themselves moulded by it. J.M. Roberts and O.A. Westad, The Penguin History of the World The dualism the authors mention here I interpret as inhering in: (1) our awareness of our cognitive and genetic limitations, that is, our inability to deal with the many complexities both that we have produced and in which we find ourselves; and (2), our capacity for conscious adaptation, for almost boundless imagination, for self-deification (which is arguably a product of the former two capacities), etc., such that we identify, as if simultaneously, as animals within and gods above the living world, and ultimate meaning must, we feel, be found in one or the other self- or collective conception (or else, much more difficult if not impossible, in both). [On the 19th-century American West] A nation of conquerors who submit themselves to living in the wilderness without ever letting themselves be seduced by its sweeter pleasures; whose only attachment to civilization and to the ideas of the Enlightenment is to whatever practical contributions they may be able to make to his well-being; who pushes himself into the solitudes of America with his ax and his papers. This is a people who, like all great peoples, has only one thought, and who pursues the acquisition of wealth, the sole object of its hard work, with a perseverance and scorn for life which might be called heroic if such a word could be applied to unvirtuous actions. It is this nomadic people that the great rivers and lakes do not stop in any way, before whom the forests fall and the prairies become shaded. It is this people who, after having touched the Pacific Ocean, will retrace its steps and disturb and destroy the society that has grown up in its wake. Alexis de Toqueville, A Fortnight in the Wilderness [Americans’] one primary and predominant object is to cultivate and settle these prairies, forests, and vast waste lands. The striking and peculiar characteristic of American society is, that it is not so much a democracy as a huge commercial company for the discovery, cultivation, and capitalization of its enormous territory. . . . The United States are primarily a commercial society . . . and only secondarily a nation. Emile Boutmy ​The new defines itself in response to what is already established; at the same time, the established has to reconfigure itself in response to the new. . . . Tradition counts for nothing when it is no longer contested and modified. A culture that is merely preserved is no culture at all. Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism ​You [Westerners] have neither the patience that weaves long lives, nor a feeling for the irregular, not a sense of the fittest place for a thing, nor a knowledge of government. You exhaust yourselves by endlessly re-beginning the work of the first day. So your ancestors are twice dead, and you . . . are afraid of death. In your land, power can do nothing. Your politics consist of changes of heart; it leads to general revolution, and then to reaction against revolution, which is another revolution. . . . For you, intelligence is not one thing among many. . . . You worship it as if it were an omnipotent beast. . . . A man intoxicated on it believes his own thoughts are legal decisions, or facts themselves born of the crowd and time. . . . You are in love with intelligence, until it frightens you. For your ideas are terrifying and your hearts are faint. Your acts of pity and cruelty are absurd, committed with no calm, as if they were irresistible. Finally, you fear blood more and more. Blood and time. . . . Yes, we men of these parts [the Far East] feed by continual millions in the most favorable valleys of the earth; and the depth of this immense sea of individuals has kept the form of a family, in an unbroken line from the earliest days. Every man here feels that he is both son and father, among thousands and tens of thousands, and is aware of being held fast by the people around him and the dead below him and the people to come, like brick in a brick wall. He holds. Every man here knows that he is nothing apart from this composite earth, and outside the miraculous structure of his ancestors. . . . You who know so many things, do not know the most ancient and powerful, and you rage with desire for what is immediate and you destroy your fathers and your sons together. . . . Here everything is a part of history: a certain flower, the sweetness of a turning moment, the delicate flesh of lakes laid bare by a sunbeam, a stirring eclipse. In these things the spirits of our fathers meet our own. Things reproduce themselves, and as we repeat the sounds they gave them for names, we are joined by memory to our fathers and made eternal. . . . We do not wish to know too much. Men's knowledge must not increase endlessly. If it continues to expand, it causes endless trouble, and despairs of itself. If it halts, decadence sets in. . . . And now remember that your great inventions had their origin with us. Do you understand now why we did not develop them further? To have singled them out for development would have spoiled the slow grandeur of our existence by disturbing the simple regularity of its course. You can see that we are not to be despised: we invented gunpowder—but for shooting off fireworks in the evening. Paul Valéry (writing in the fictional character of a Chinese scholar), ``The Yalu\" An Orwellian world is much easier to recognize and to oppose than a Huxleyan. Everything in our background has prepared us to know and to resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us. . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse devolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture’s being drained by laughter? Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death Back to Top Back to Commonplace Book",

    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Death Death is a dignitary who, when he comes announced, is to be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him. Ambrose Bierce, “An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge” Perhaps an individual must consider his own death to be the final phenomenon of nature. Stephen Crane, “The Open Boat” There is something nightmarish about the scaffold when it is standing there ready. It is possible to feel a certain indifference about the death penalty, not to declare yourself, to say yes and no, so long as you have not seen a guillotine with your own eyes. But if you do come across one, it has a violent impact. You are forced to make a decision, to take sides, for or against. . . . The guillotine is the law made concrete. Its name is retribution. It is not neutral and does not allow you to remain neutral. Whoever sees it shudders with the most mysterious of shudders. All social problems raise question marks around this blade. The scaffold is not a structure. The scaffold is not a machine. The scaffold is not an inert contraption made of wood, iron and rope. It is as though it were some kind of being with its own sinister initiative. To all appearances this wooden construction can see, this machine can hear, this contraption can understand, this wood, this iron and this rope have a will of their own. Its presence casts the soul into a ghastly trance in which the scaffold appears terrifying and involved in what it is doing. The scaffold is the executioner's accomplice. It devours. It eats flesh. It drinks blood. The scaffold is a kind of monster put together by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre that seems to live by some dreadful life force created out of all the death it has inflicted. Victor Hugo, Les Misérables (trans. Christine Donougher) . . .When thoughts of the last bitter hour come like a blight Over thy spirit, and sad images Of stern agony, and shroud, and pall, And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;&mdash; Go forth under the open sky, and list To Nature's teachings, while from all around&mdash; Earth and her waters, and the depths of air,&mdash; ​Comes a still voice&mdash;Yet a few days, and thee The all-beholding sun shall see no more In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground, Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears, Nor in the embrace of ocean shall exist Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim Thy growth, to be resolv'd to earth again; And, lost each human trace, surrend'ring up Thine individual being, shalt thou go To mix forever with the elements, To be a brother to th' insensible rock And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain Turns with his share, and treads upon. . . . Yet not to thy eternal resting place Shalt thou retire alone&mdash;nor couldst thou wish Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down ​With patriarchs of the infant world&mdash;with kings, The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good, Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, All in one mighty sepulchre. . . . . . . All that breathe Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care Plod on, and each one as before will chase His favourite phantom; yet all these shall leave Their mirth and their employments, and shall come, And make their bed with thee. As the long train Of ages glide away, the sons of men, The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes In the full strength of years, matron, and maid, The bow'd with age, the infant in the smiles And beauty of its innocent age cut off,&mdash; Shall one by one be gathered to thy side, By those, who in their turn shall follow them. So live, that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan, that moves To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death, Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but sustain'd and sooth'd By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave, Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch ​About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams. William Cullen Bryant, “Thanatopsis” If he be dead&mdash;O no, it cannot be, Seeing his beauty, thou shoudst strike at it&mdash; O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see, But hatefully at random dost thou hit: Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart. Shakespeare, Venus and Adonis For I know that I am mortal, Not secure of life one hour, And ‘tis doubtless to exhibit Life and death's divided power, That the cradle and the coffin Are so like each other wrought; For it is a natural action When a man receiveth aught, That his hands he raiseth upward, Joined together in this way. But should he express refusal, By a similar action, may His intent be known, by simply Turning them averted down; So, the world, to prove it seeks us When we're born, without a frown In a cradle doth receive us, Leaving us securely lain In its open arms: but should it, Or through fury or disdain, Wish to drive us forth, it turneth Back her hands, with the intent, That the coffin's mute material Be of that same instrument, For an upturned open cradle When reversed, becomes a tomb. Since we live in such assurance Of our death&mdash;the common doom&mdash; That when we are born, together We our first and last bed see; . . . But since deathwards all men doth wend, What is there that ends not so? In the world's confused abyss, Sickness ever leads to this, When death strikes the fatal blow. Man, be mindful, here below, Of thy soul's sublimer part; Think upon eternity, Wait not till infirmity Suddenly that truth impart&mdash; For infirmity itself thou art. On the hard earth, year by year, Man in treading, hopeful, brave, But each step is o'er his grave, Daily drawing near and near. Mournful sentence&mdash;law severe&mdash; But which cannot be mistaken, Every step (what fears awaken!) Is to that dark goal commissioned, So that God is not sufficient To prevent that step being taken . . . Pedro Calderón de la Barca, The Constant Prince Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel? Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. O, that that earth which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw! Shakespeare, Hamlet In the depths of his soul Ivan Ilyich knew that he was dying, but not only was he not accustomed to it, he simply did not, he could not possibly understand it. The example of a syllogism he had studied in Kiesewetter's logic&mdash;Caius is a man, men are mortal, therefore Caius is mortal&mdash;had seemed to him all his life to be correct only in relation to Caius, but by no means to himself. For the man Caius, man in general, it was perfectly correct; but he was not Caius and not man in general, he had always been quite, quite separate from all other beings; he was Vanya, with mamá, with papá, with Mitya and Volodya, with toys, the coachman, with a nanny, then with Katenka, with all the joys, griefs, and delights of childhood, boyhood, and youth. Was it for Caius, the smell of the striped leather ball that Vanya had loved so much? Was it Caius who had kissed his mother's hand like that, and was it for Caius that the silk folds of his mother's dress had rustled like that? Was it he who had mutinied against bad food in law school? Was it Caius who had been in love like that? Was it Caius who could conduct a court session like that? And Caius is indeed mortal, and it is right that he die, but for me, Vanya, Ivan Ilyich, with all my feelings and thoughts&mdash;for me it is another matter. And it cannot be that I should die. It would be too terrible. So it felt to him. “If I was to die, like Caius, I would have known it, my inner voice would have told me so, but there was nothing of the sort in me; and I and all my friends understood that things were quite otherwise than with Caius. And now look!” he said to himself. “It can't be. It can't be, but it is. How can it be? How can I understand it?” And he could not understand and tried to drive this thought away as false, incorrect, morbid, and to dislodge it with other correct, healthy thoughts. But this thought, not only a thought but as if a reality, came back again and stood before him. And he called up a series of other thoughts in place of this thought, in hopes of finding support in them. He tried to go back to his former ways of thinking, which had screened him formerly from the thought of death. But&mdash;strange thing&mdash;all that had formerly screened, hidden, wiped out the consciousness of death now could no longer produce that effect. . . . And what was worst of all was that it drew him to itself not so that he would do something, but only so that he should look at it straight in the eye, look at it and, doing nothing, suffer inexpressibly. And to save himself from this state, Ivan Ilyich looked for consolation, for other screens, and other screens appeared and for a short time seemed to save him, but at once they were again not so much destroyed as made transparent, as if itpenetrated everything and there was no screening it out. . . . He would go to his study, lie down, and again remain alone with it. Face to face with it, and there was nothing to be done with it. Only look at it and go cold. Leo Tolstoy, “The Death of Ivan Ilyich” To chime the notes of his emotion, a verse mysteriously entered the correspondent's head. He had even forgotten that he had forgotten this verse, but it suddenly was in his mind. A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's tears, But a comrade stood beside him, and he took that comrade's hand, And he said: ‘I never more shall see my own, my native land.’ In his childhood, the correspondent had been made acquainted with the fact that a soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, but he had never regarded it as important. Myriads of his school-fellows had informed him of the soldier's plight, but the dinning had naturally ended by making him perfectly indifferent. He had never considered it his affair that a soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, nor had it appeared to him as a matter for sorrow. It was less to him than the breaking of a pencil's point. Now, however, it quaintly came to him as a human, living thing. It was no longer merely a picture of a few throes in the breast of a poet, meanwhile drinking tea and warming his feet at the grate; it was an actuality&mdash;stern, mournful, and fine. Stephen Crane, “The Open Boat” To chime the notes of his emotion, a verse mysteriously entered the correspondent's head. He had even forgotten that he had forgotten this verse, but it suddenly was in his mind.

It was no longer merely a picture of a few throes in the breast of a poet, meanwhile drinking tea and warming his feet at the grate; it was an actuality&mdash;stern, mournful, and fine. Stephen Crane, “The Open Boat” Long ago has been told the Eastern story about the traveller who in the steppe is overtaken by an infuriated beast. Trying to save himself from the animal, the traveller jumps into a waterless well, but at its bottom he sees a dragon who opens his jaws in order to swallow him. And the unfortunate man does not dare climb out, lest he perish from the infuriated beast, and does not dare jump down to the bottom of the well, lest he be devoured by the dragon, and so clutches the twig of a wild bush growing in a cleft of the well and holds on to it. His hands grow weak and he feels that soon he shall have to surrender to the peril which awaits him at either side; but he still holds on and sees two mice, one white, the other black, in even measure making at it on all sides. Now, at any moment, the bush will break and tear off, and he will fall into the dragon's jaws. The traveller sees that and knows that he will inevitably perish; but while he is still clinging, he sees some drops of honey hanging on the leaves of the bush, and so reaches out for them with his tongue and licks the leaves. Just so I hold on to the branch of life, knowing that the dragon of death is waiting inevitably for me, ready to tear me to pieces, and I cannot understand why I have fallen on such suffering. And I try to lick the honey which used to give me pleasure; but now it no longer gives me joy, and the white and the black mouse day and night nibble at the branch to which I am holding on. . . . I see only the inevitable dragon and the mice, and am unable to turn my glance away from them. This is not a fable, but a veritable, indisputable, comprehensible truth. Leo Tolstoy, “My Confession” Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turn'd round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.

    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Education ​Socrates [tells] a story of origins to Phaedrus. . . . that the ancient Egyptians had a divinity called Theuth, who discovered number, reckoning, geometry, astronomy, checkers and dice, and writing. Theuth brought these gifts to Thamus at Egyptian Thebes. Concerning writing, Socrates reports, Theuth said: “O King, here is something that, once learned, will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memory; I have discovered a potion for memory and for wisdom.” Thamus, however, replied, “. . . In fact, it will induce forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it: they will not practice using their memory because they will put their trust in writing . . . You have not discovered a potion for remembering, but for reminding; you provide your students with the appearance of wisdom, not with its reality. Your invention will enable them to hear many things without being properly taught, and they will imagine that they have come to know much while for the most part they will know nothing. Constance Meinwald, Plato This quote, far from being a broad injunction against reading the written word (or of any newfangled technology, as Plato is often accused of making), is rather an injunction, first, against merely reading. That is, reading without recapitulating, passively reviewing the information of others as if one will somehow thereby come to own it; or reading without teaching, without transmitting the knowledge one has learned. Moreover, it is an injunction against the notion that access to information is equivalent to application of information. As Meinwald points out, the general public now has more access to “medical” information than ever before, for example, but this has not only not benefitted the public but in many ways has harmed it&mdash;thanks mostly to those who believe that medical information in the hands of just anyone, rather than someone who has spent decades utilizing and interpreting and understanding the nuance of that information, is just as good. ​The business of education is to give the student both useful information and life-enhancing experience, one largely measurable, the other not; and since the life-enhancing value of a course in literature is difficult to measure&mdash;since, moreover, many people in a position to put pressure on educational programs have no real experience in or feeling for the arts&mdash;it is often tempting to treat life-enhancement courses as course in useful information, putting them on the same “objective” level as courses in civics, geometry, or elementary physics. So it comes about that books are taught (officially, at least) not because they give joy, the incomparably rich experience we ask and expect of all true art, but because, as a curriculum committee might put it, they “illustrate major themes in American literature,” or “present a clearly stated point of view and can thus serve as a vehicle for [various] curriculum objectives. . . .” One cannot exactly say that such teaching is pernicious, but to treat great works of literature in this way seems a little like arguing for preservation of dolphins, whales, chimps, and gorillas solely on the grounds of ecological balance.

    "content": "David Kendall Casey Commonplace Book Home Commonplace Book Writing Speaking Research ← Back to Commonplace Book On Existence [We] exist in such a peculiar world that living is merely dreaming; and the experience teaches me that the man who lives dreams his reality until he awakes. The king dreams that he's a king, and lives in that deception, giving orders, making decisions, and ruling; and that acclaim, which he receives as a loan, is written on the wind and changed into ashes by death (a great misfortune!): to think that there are people who try to reign knowing that they must awaken in the sleep of death! The rich man dreams about his riches, which cause him greater worries; the poor man dreams that he is suffering his misery and poverty; the man beginning to thrive is just dreaming, the man who tolls and strives is just dreaming, the man who affronts and injures is just dreaming, and, to sum up, in this world all men merely dream what they are, though no one realizes it. . . . . [S]eeing that life is so short, let us dream, my soul, let us dream once again; but now it must be with the awareness and knowledge that we must awaken from this pleasurable dream just when we're happiest; for, keeping that in mind, our disappointment won't be so great; because to take counsel against harm in advance is to laugh at it. And with this foreknowledge that . . . all my power is merely borrowed and must return to its Owner, let us adventure everything! Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Life is a Dream When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply the fact that there are no bricks and no temples. Any visible expression of nature would surely be pelleted with his jeers. Then, if there be no tangible thing to hoot he feels, perhaps, the desire to confront a personification and indulge in pleas, bowed to one knee, and with hands supplicant, saying: “Yes, but I love myself.” A high cold star on a winter's night is the word he feels that she says to him. Thereafter he knows the pathos of his situation. Stephen Crane, “The Open Boat” When we consider things attentively, when we see the powerful, irresistible impulse with which waterfalls rush to the depths of the Earth, how the magnet always turns to the magnetic pole and iron rushes toward the magnet; when we note the violence with which two electric poles try to unite, a violence further intensified by obstacles, as are human desires; . . . then we will not need any great stretch of imagination to recognize, albeit from a great distance, our own essence, the very same essence which, within ourselves, pursues its goals enlightened by knowledge, but which here, in the weakest of its manifestations, strives blindly, dully and invariably, and which nevertheless, because it is everywhere one and the same—as the first light of dawn shares the name of sunlight with the full brightness of noon—must here too bear the name of will, which refers to the being of every thing in the world and the unique core of every phenomenon. . . . [Yet] the absence of any goal and any limit is essential to the will in itself, which is an endless striving. This . . . is also manifested in its simplest form at the lowest degree of objecthood of the will, namely gravity, whose constant striving, joined to the impossibility of reaching an ultimate goal, is clear to see. Suppose that all matter, in accordance with its will, were to clump together in a compact mass; gravity striving toward the centre would still struggle with impenetrability, in the form of rigidity or elasticity. The striving of matter can only be impeded, never realized or satisfied. So it is with the strivings of all manifestations of the will; every goal attained is the beginning of a new career, and this process has no end. The plant raises its manifestations from the seed to the stem, to the leaf, to the flower, to the fruit, and this is only the beginning of a new seed, a new individual that will, however, pursue the same old course, and so on for all eternity. . . . An eternal becoming, an endless flow: these are the manifestations of the nature of willing. The same can thing is unceasingly displayed in human endeavours and desires, whose realization is always dangled before us as the ultimate goal of our will; as soon as they are satisfied they are no longer recognized, they are soon forgotten, like something antiquated—and, truth to tell, even if we hide this fact from ourselves, we cast them aside as vanished illusions. Happy indeed is the man who still has desires and aspirations: he can continue from desire to its satisfaction, and from thence to another desire; when this movement is fast, it means happiness, and unhappiness when it is slow. At least he will not fall into a dreadful, paralysing stagnation, a dull desire with no definite object, a deadly languor. Arthur Schopenhauer In the spectacle of death, in the endurance of intolerable pain, and in the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a sacredness, an overpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, of the depth, the inexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some strange marriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by bonds of sorrow. In these moments of insight, we lose all eagerness of temporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends, all care for the little trivial things that, to a superficial view, make up the common life of day by day; we see, surrounding the narrow raft illuminated by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean on whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour; from the great night without, a chill blast breaks in upon our refuge; all the loneliness of humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated upon the individual soul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command, against the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its hopes and fears. Victory, in this struggle with the powers of darkness, is the true baptism into the glorious company of heroes, the true initiation into the overmastering beauty of human existence. From that awful encounter of the soul with the outer world, renunciation, wisdom, and charity are born; and with their birth a new life begins. To take into the inmost shrine of the soul of the irresistible forces whose puppets we seem to be—death and change, the irrevocableness of the past, and the powerlessness of man before the blind hurry of the universe from vanity to vanity—to feel these things and know them is to conquer them. United with his fellow men by the strongest of all ties, the tie of a common doom, the free man finds that a new vision is with him always, shedding over every daily task the light of love. The life of man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, toward a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instill faith in hours of despair. Let us not weight in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need—of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindness, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy with ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed. Betrand Russell, “A Free Man's Worship” The sentimentalist does not look into the depths of nature and see Sluggish existences grazing there, suspended or slowly crawling close to the bottom: . . . . The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sea-leopard, and the sting-ray, Passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes—sight in those ocean depths—breathing that thick breathing air. Man has to discover that everything which he beholds in nature—the clammy foreign-feeling world of the ocean's depths, the wastes of ice, the reptiles of the swamp, the spiders and scorpions, the deserts of lifeless planets—has its counterpart within himself. He is not, then, at one with himself until he realizes that this “underside” of nature and the feelings of horror which it gives him are also “I.” Alan Watts (quoting Whitman), The Wisdom of Insecurity God made mud. God got lonesome. So God said to some of the mud, “Sit up!” “See all I've made,” said God, “the hills, the sea, the sky, the stars.” And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look around. Lucky me, lucky mud. I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done. Nice going, God. Nobody but you could have done it, God! ​I certainly couldn't have. I feel very unimportant compared to You. The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that didn't even get to sit up and look around. I got so much, and most got so little. Thank you for the honor! Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep. What memories for mud to have! What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met! I loved everything I saw! Good night. Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle To Dr. Faustus in his study Mephistophelis told the history of the Creation, saying, “The endless praises of the choirs of angels had begun to grow wearisome; for, after all, did he not deserve their praise? Had he not given them endless joy? Would it not be more amusing to obtain undeserved praise, to be worshipped by beings whom he tortured? He smiled inwardly, and resolved that the great drama should be performed.” For countless ages the hot nebula whirled aimlessly through space. At length it began to take shape, the central mass threw off planets, the planets cooled, boiling seas and burning mountains heaved and tossed, from black masses of cloud hot sheets of rain deluged the barely solid crust. And now the first germ of life grew in the depths of the ocean and developed rapidly in the fructifying warmth into vast forest trees, huge ferns springing from the damp mold, sea monsters breeding, fighting, devouring, and passing away. And from the monsters, as the play unfolded itself, Man was born, with the power of thought, the knowledge of good and evil, and the cruel thirst for worship. And Man saw that all is passing in this mad, monstrous world, that all is struggling to snatch, at any cost, a few brief moments of life before Death's inexorable decree. And Man said, “There is a hidden purpose, could we but fathom it, and the purpose is good; for we must reverence something, and in the visible world there is nothing worthy of reverence.” And Man stood aside from the struggle, resolving that God intended harmony to come out of chaos by human efforts. And when he followed the beasts of prey, he called it Sin, and asked God to forgive him. But he doubted whether he could be justly forgiven, until he invented a divine Plan by which God's wrath was to have been appeased. And seeing the present was bad, he made it yet worse, that thereby the future might be better. And he gave God thanks for the strength that enabled him to forgo even the joys that were possible. And God smiled; and when he saw that Man had become perfect in renunciation and worship, he sent another sun through the sky, which crashed into Man's sun; and all returned again to nebula. “Yes,” he murmured, “it was a good play; I will have it performed again.” Bertrand Russell, “A Free Man's Worship” Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring, Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill'd with the foolish, Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?) Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew'd, Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me, Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined, The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life? Answer. That you are here—that life exists and identity, That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. Walt Whitman, “Oh Me! Oh Life!” ​One must always be drunk. Everything lies in that; it is the only question worth considering. In order not to feel the horrible burden of time which breaks your shoulders and bows you down to earth, you must intoxicate yourself without truce, but with what? With wine, poetry, or art?—As you will; but intoxicate yourself! And if sometimes upon the steps of a palace, or upon the green grass of a moat, or in the sad solitude of your own room, you awake, intoxication already diminished or disappeared, ask of the wind, of the wave, of the star, of the bird, of the clock, of all that flies, of all that groans, of all that rolls, of all that sings, of all that speaks,—ask what time is it? And the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock, will answer you, “It is time to intoxicate yourself!”In order to escape from the slavish martyrdom of time, intoxicate yourself, unceasingly intoxicate yourself;—with wine, or poetry, or art, which you will.

Because it's just as accurate with regard to bad things as it is uncertain with regard to the good. What a wonderful astrologer I would be if I always foretold dire events, because there's no doubt they would always come to pass! Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Life is a Dream The tale is told of a wise man who once was so poor and indigent that his sole nourishment was a few herbs that he picked. “Can there be another man,” he said to himself, “poorer and sadder than I?” And when he turned his face, he found the answer, beholding another wise man who was gathering the leaves that he had discarded. Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Life is a Dream Our path through life is strewn with many . . . sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavors. James Joyce, “The Dead” Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Mary Shelley, Frankenstein There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend, And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming, Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming And humming sands, where windy surges wend: And he called loudly to the stars to bend From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they Among themselves laugh on and sing alway: And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story! The sea swept on and cried her old cry still, Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill. And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping, Cried all his story to the dew drops glistening. But naught they heard, for they are always listening. And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend Sought once again the shore, and found a shell, And thought, I will my heavy story tell Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart; And my own tale again for me shall sing, And my own whispering words will be comforting, And lo! my ancient burden may depart. Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim; But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him. W.B. Yeats, “The Sad Shepherd” ​Suffering cannot disappear, but la misère [wretchedness] must disappear. There will always be unfortunates, but it is possible that there will be no more misérables. Victor Hugo, ​When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions . . . Shakespeare, Hamlet The sole recourse usually is to the tenement where, heaped floor above floor, in a tainted atmosphere, or in low fetid hovels, amidst poverty, hunger and dirt, in foulness, want and crime, crowded humanity suffers, and sickens, and perishes; for the landlord here is also the air-lord, the lord of sunlight, lord of all the primary conditions of life and living; and these are doled out for a price, failing which the wretched tenant is turned out to seek a habitation still more miserable.
