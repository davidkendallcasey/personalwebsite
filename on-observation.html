		<blockquote>Seeing clearly is an ethical act&mdash;to witness, rather than to consume, to attend, rather than to judge. In the end, perhaps the truest form of observation is humility: to look closely enough to notice the changing world&mdash;and to know that we, too, are changed in the act of looking; through our own careful, conscious observation.</blockquote>

			<blockquote><p>No observation is without consequence. Point a camera at a crowd, and people begin to perform. Ask a child to &ldquo; act natural&rdquo; and watch how quickly they stiffen. Even in solitude, the sense of being watched&mdash;by others, by unseen authority, by the imagined gaze of society&mdash;shapes what we do. The mirror of attention changes the one reflected within it.</p>
			<p>...</p>
			<p>To recognize this is not to despair of objectivity, but to approach it from another angle. Every gaze creates a form of power; every witness  leaves a trace. We are never simply watching&mdash;we are participating, altering, and prompting change just by being there.</p>
			<p>To observe well is to know this, to see both outward and inward at once, aware that every act of looking, however small, shapes the field that it surveys. The light we cast, like that of a particle in motion, illuminates and disturbs in equal measure.</p></blockquote>
