                Mysteries are not to be avoided. Rather they are a locus of hope, they enrich and complicate. That is why we have them. That is perhaps one of the reasons we have children.

				The first woman was named Pandora. She was made in heaven, every god contributing something to perfect her. . . . Thus equipped, she was conveyed to earth, and presented to Epimetheus, who gladly accepted her, though cautioned his brother [Prometheus] to beware of Jupiter and his gifts. Epimetheus had in his house a jar, in which were kept certain noxious articles, for which, in fitting man for his new abode, he had had no occasion. Pandora was seized with an eager curiosity to know what this jar contained; and one day she slipped off the cover and looked in. Forthwith there escaped a multitude of plagues for hapless man&mdash;such as gout, rheumatism, and colic for his body, and envy, spite, and revenge for his mind—and scattered themselves far and wide. Pandora hastened to replace the lid! but, alas! the whole contents of the jar had escaped, one thing only excepted, which lay at the bottom, and that was <i>hope</i>. So we see at this day, whatever evils are abroad, hope never entirely leaves us; and while we have <i>that</i>, no amount of other ills can make us completely wretched.
