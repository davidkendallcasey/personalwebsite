            <blockquote>
               <p>The existentialist frankly states that man is in anguish. His meaning is as follows: When a man commits himself to anything, fully realizing that he is not only choosing what he will be, but thereby at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind&mdash;in such a moment a man cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility.</p>
			   <p>Who, then, can prove that I am the proper person to impose, by my own choice, my conception of man upon mankind? I shall never find any proof whatever; there will be no sign to convince me of it. ... Clearly, the anguish with which we are concerned here is not one that could lead to quietism or inaction. It is anguish pure and simple, of the kind well known to all those who have borne responsibilities. ... All leaders know that anguish. It does not prevent their acting, on the contrary, it is the very condition of their action, for the action presupposes that there is a plurality of possibilities, and in choosing one of these, they realise that it has value only because it is chosen. ... That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does.</p>

               The current that with gente murmur glides,<br>
                Thou know'st, being stopped, impatiently doth rage:<br>
                But when his fair course is not hinderèd,<br>
                He makes sweet music with th'enameled stones,<br>
                Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br>
                He overtaketh in his pilgrimmage,<br>
                And so by many winding nooks he strays<br>
                With willing sport to the wild ocean.
