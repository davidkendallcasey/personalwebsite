                What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness, and say to you, &ldquo;This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence.&rdquo; ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: &ldquo;You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.&rdquo;

                [William Stoner] had come to that moment in his age when there occurred to him, with increasing intensity, a question of such overwhelming simplicity that he had no means to face it. He found himself wondering if his life were worth the living; if it had ever been. It was a question, he suspected, that came to all men at one time or another; he wondered if it came to them with such impersonal force as it came to him. The question brought with it a sadness, but it was a general sadness which (he thought) had little to do with himself or with his particular fate; he was not even sure that the question sprang from the most immediate and obvious causes, from what his own life had become. It came, he believed, from the accretion of his years, from the density of accident and circumstance, and from what he had come to understand of them. He took a grim and ironic pleasure from the possibility that what little learning he had managed to acquire had led him to this knowledge: that in the long run all things, even the learning that let him know this, were futile and empty, and at last diminished into a nothingness they did not alter.

                <p>When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply the fact that there are no bricks and no temples. Any visible expression of nature would surely be pelleted with his jeers.</p>
				<p>Then, if there be no tangible thing to hoot he feels, perhaps, the desire to confront a personification and indulge in pleas, bowed to one knee, and with hands supplicant, saying: &ldquo;Yes, but I love myself.&rdquo;</p>
				A high cold star on a winter's night is the word he feels that she says to him. Thereafter he knows the pathos of his situation.

            <blockquote>
                <p>When we consider things attentively, when we see the powerful, irresistible impulse with which waterfalls rush to the depths of the Earth, how the magnet always turns to the magnetic pole and iron rushes toward the magnet; when we note the violence with which two electric poles try to unite, a violence further intensified by obstacles, as are human desires; . . . then we will not need any great stretch of imagination to recognize, albeit from a great distance, our own essence, the very same essence which, within ourselves, pursues its goals enlightened by knowledge, but which here, in the weakest of its manifestations, strives blindly, dully and invariably, and which nevertheless, because it is everywhere one and the same—as the first light of dawn shares the name of sunlight with the full brightness of noon—must here too bear the name of will, which refers to the being of every thing in the world and the unique core of every phenomenon. . . .</p>
				<p>[Yet] the absence of any goal and any limit is essential to the will in itself, which is an endless striving. This . . . is also manifested in its simplest form at the lowest degree of objecthood of the will, namely gravity, whose constant striving, joined to the impossibility of reaching an ultimate goal, is clear to see. Suppose that all matter, in accordance with its will, were to clump together in a compact mass; gravity striving toward the centre would still struggle with impenetrability, in the form of rigidity or elasticity. The striving of matter can only be impeded, never realized or satisfied. So it is with the strivings of all manifestations of the will; every goal attained is the beginning of a new career, and this process has no end. The plant raises its manifestations from the seed to the stem, to the leaf, to the flower, to the fruit, and this is only the beginning of a new seed, a new individual that will, however, pursue the same old course, and so on for all eternity. . . . An eternal becoming, an endless flow: these are the manifestations of the nature of willing. The same can thing is unceasingly displayed in human endeavours and desires, whose realization is always dangled before us as the ultimate goal of our will; as soon as they are satisfied they are no longer recognized, they are soon forgotten, like something antiquated—and, truth to tell, even if we hide this fact from ourselves, we cast them aside as vanished illusions. Happy indeed is the man who still has desires and aspirations: he can continue from desire to its satisfaction, and from thence to another desire; when this movement is fast, it means happiness, and unhappiness when it is slow. At least he will not fall into a dreadful, paralysing stagnation, a dull desire with no definite object, a deadly languor.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In the spectacle of death, in the endurance of intolerable pain, and in the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a sacredness, an overpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, of the depth, the inexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some strange marriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by bonds of sorrow. In these moments of insight, we lose all eagerness of temporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends, all care for the little trivial things that, to a superficial view, make up the common life of day by day; we see, surrounding the narrow raft illuminated by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean on whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour; from the great night without, a chill blast breaks in upon our refuge; all the loneliness of humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated upon the individual soul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command, against the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its hopes and fears. Victory, in this struggle with the powers of darkness, is the true baptism into the glorious company of heroes, the true initiation into the overmastering beauty of human existence. From that awful encounter of the soul with the outer world, renunciation, wisdom, and charity are born; and with their birth a new life begins. To take into the inmost shrine of the soul of the irresistible forces whose puppets we seem to be&mdash;death and change, the irrevocableness of the past, and the powerlessness of man before the blind hurry of the universe from vanity to vanity&mdash;to feel these things and know them is to conquer them.</p>
				<p>United with his fellow men by the strongest of all ties, the tie of a common doom, the free man finds that a new vision is with him always, shedding over every daily task the light of love. The life of man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, toward a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instill faith in hours of despair. Let us not weight in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need&mdash;of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindness, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy with ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;The endless praises of the choirs of angels had begun to grow wearisome; for, after all, did he not deserve their praise? Had he not given them endless joy?

					For countless ages the hot nebula whirled aimlessly through space. At length it began to take shape, the central mass threw off planets, the planets cooled, boiling seas and burning mountains heaved and tossed, from black masses of cloud hot sheets of rain deluged the barely solid crust. And now the first germ of life grew in the depths of the ocean and developed rapidly in the fructifying warmth into vast forest trees, huge ferns springing from the damp mold, sea monsters breeding, fighting, devouring, and passing away. And from the monsters, as the play unfolded itself, Man was born, with the power of thought, the knowledge of good and evil, and the cruel thirst for worship. And Man saw that all is passing in this mad, monstrous world, that all is struggling to snatch, at any cost, a few brief moments of life before Death's inexorable decree. And Man said, &ldquo;There is a hidden purpose, could we but fathom it, and the purpose is good; for we must reverence something, and in the visible world there is nothing worthy of reverence.&rdquo; And Man stood aside from the struggle, resolving that God intended harmony to come out of chaos by human efforts. And when he followed the beasts of prey, he called it Sin, and asked God to forgive him. But he doubted whether he could be justly forgiven, until he invented a divine Plan by which God's wrath was to have been appeased. And seeing the present was bad, he made it yet worse, that thereby the future might be better. And he gave God thanks for the strength that enabled him to forgo even the joys that were possible. And God smiled; and when he saw that Man had become perfect in renunciation and worship, he sent another sun through the sky, which crashed into Man's sun; and all returned again to nebula.
